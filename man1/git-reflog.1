.SH "NAME"
git\-reflog \- Manage reflog information
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fIgit reflog\fR <subcommand> <options>
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The command takes various subcommands, and different options depending on the subcommand:
.sp
.nf
git reflog expire [\-\-dry\-run] [\-\-stale\-fix]
        [\-\-expire=<time>] [\-\-expire\-unreachable=<time>] [\-\-all] <refs>\&...
.fi
git reflog [show] [log\-options]

Reflog is a mechanism to record when the tip of branches are updated. This command is to manage the information recorded in it.

The subcommand "expire" is used to prune older reflog entries. Entries older than expire time, or entries older than expire\-unreachable time and are not reachable from the current tip, are removed from the reflog. This is typically not used directly by the end users \(em instead, see \fBgit\-gc\fR(1).

The subcommand "show" (which is also the default, in the absense of any subcommands) will take all the normal log options, and show the log of the current branch. It is basically an alias for \fIgit log \-g \-\-abbrev\-commit \-\-pretty=oneline\fR, see \fBgit\-log\fR(1).
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\-\-expire=<time>
Entries older than this time are pruned. Without the option it is taken from configuration gc.reflogExpire, which in turn defaults to 90 days.
.TP
\-\-expire\-unreachable=<time>
Entries older than this time and are not reachable from the current tip of the branch are pruned. Without the option it is taken from configuration gc.reflogExpireUnreachable, which in turn defaults to 30 days.
.TP
\-\-all
Instead of listing <refs> explicitly, prune all refs.
