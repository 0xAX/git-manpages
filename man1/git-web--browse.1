.SH "NAME"
git\-web\-\-browse \- git helper script to launch a web browser
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fIgit\-web\-\-browse\fR [OPTIONS] URL/FILE \&...
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This script tries, as much as possible, to display the URLs and FILEs that are passed as arguments, as HTML pages in new tabs on an already opened web browser.

The following browsers (or commands) are currently supported:
.TP 3
\(bu
firefox (this is the default under X Window when not using KDE)
.TP
\(bu
iceweasel
.TP
\(bu
konqueror (this is the default under KDE)
.TP
\(bu
w3m (this is the default outside graphical environments)
.TP
\(bu
links
.TP
\(bu
lynx
.TP
\(bu
dillo
.TP
\(bu
open (this is the default under Mac OS X GUI)
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\-b BROWSER|\-\-browser=BROWSER
Use the specified BROWSER. It must be in the list of supported browsers.
.TP
\-t BROWSER|\-\-tool=BROWSER
Same as above.
.TP
\-c CONF.VAR|\-\-config=CONF.VAR
CONF.VAR is looked up in the git config files. If it's set, then its value specify the browser that should be used.
.SH "CONFIGURATION VARIABLES"
The web browser can be specified using a configuration variable passed with the \-c (or \-\-config) command line option, or the \fIweb.browser\fR configuration variable if the former is not used.

You can explicitly provide a full path to your preferred browser by setting the configuration variable \fIbrowser.<tool>.path\fR. For example, you can configure the absolute path to firefox by setting \fIbrowser.firefox.path\fR. Otherwise, \fIgit\-web\-\-browse\fR assumes the tool is available in PATH.

Note that these configuration variables should probably be set using the \fI\-\-global\fR flag, for example like this:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ git config \-\-global web.browser firefox
.ft

.fi
as they are probably more user specific than repository specific. See \fBgit\-config\fR(1) for more information about this.
