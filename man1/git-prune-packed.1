.SH "NAME"
git\-prune\-packed \- Remove extra objects that are already in pack files
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fIgit\-prune\-packed\fR [\-n] [\-q]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This program searches the $GIT_OBJECT_DIR for all objects that currently exist in a pack file as well as the independent object directories.

All such extra objects are removed.

A pack is a collection of objects, individually compressed, with delta compression applied, stored in a single file, with an associated index file.

Packs are used to reduce the load on mirror systems, backup engines, disk storage, etc.
.SH "OPTIONS"
