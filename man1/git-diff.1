.SH NAME
git-diff \- Show changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc
.SH "SYNOPSIS"


\fIgit\-diff\fR [ \-\-diff\-options ] <ent>{0,2} [<path>...]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"


Show changes between two ents, an ent and the working tree, an ent and the index file, or the index file and the working tree\&. The combination of what is compared with what is determined by the number of ents given to the command\&.

.TP 3
\(bu
When no <ent> is given, the working tree and the index file is compared, using git\-diff\-files\&.
.TP
\(bu
When one <ent> is given, the working tree and the named tree is compared, using git\-diff\-index\&. The option \-\-cached can be given to compare the index file and the named tree\&.
.TP
\(bu
When two <ent>s are given, these two trees are compared using git\-diff\-tree\&.
.LP

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
\-\-diff\-options
 \fI\-\-diff\-options\fR are passed to the git\-diff\-files, git\-diff\-index, and git\-diff\-tree commands\&. See the documentation for these commands for description\&.

.TP
<path>...
The <path> arguments are also passed to git\-diff\-* commands\&.

.SH "EXAMPLES"

.TP
Various ways to check your working tree

.nf
$ git diff 
$ git diff \-\-cached 
$ git diff HEAD 

 changes in the working tree since your last git\-update\-index\&.
 changes between the index and your last commit; what you
would be committing if you run "git commit" without "\-a" option\&.
 changes in the working tree since your last commit; what you
would be committing if you run "git commit \-a"
.fi

.TP
Comparing with arbitrary commits

.nf
$ git diff test 
$ git diff HEAD \-\- \&./test 
$ git diff HEAD^ HEAD 

 instead of using the tip of the current branch, compare with the
tip of "test" branch\&.
 instead of comparing with the tip of "test" branch, compare with
the tip of the current branch, but limit the comparison to the
file "test"\&.
 compare the version before the last commit and the last commit\&.
.fi

.TP
Limiting the diff output

.nf
$ git diff \-\-diff\-filter=MRC 
$ git diff \-\-name\-status \-r 
$ git diff arch/i386 include/asm\-i386 

 show only modification, rename and copy, but not addition
nor deletion\&.
 show only names and the nature of change, but not actual
diff output\&.  \-\-name\-status disables usual patch generation
which in turn also disables recursive behaviour, so without \-r
you would only see the directory name if there is a change in a
file in a subdirectory\&.
 limit diff output to named subtrees\&.
.fi

.TP
Munging the diff output

.nf
$ git diff \-\-find\-copies\-harder \-B \-C 
$ git diff \-R 

 spend extra cycles to find renames, copies and complete
rewrites (very expensive)\&.
 output diff in reverse\&.
.fi
