.SH "NAME"
git-check-ref-format - Make sure ref name is well formed
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fIgit check\-ref\-format\fR <refname>
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Checks if a given \fIrefname\fR is acceptable, and exits non\-zero if it is not\.

A reference is used in git to specify branches and tags\. A branch head is stored under $GIT_DIR/refs/heads directory, and a tag is stored under $GIT_DIR/refs/tags directory\. git imposes the following rules on how refs are named:

.sp
.RS 4
\h'-04' 1.\h'+02'It can include slash / for hierarchical (directory) grouping, but no slash\-separated component can begin with a dot \.;
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
\h'-04' 2.\h'+02'It cannot have two consecutive dots \.\. anywhere;
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
\h'-04' 3.\h'+02'It cannot have ASCII control character (i\.e\. bytes whose values are lower than \e040, or \e177 DEL), space, tilde ~, caret ^, colon :, question\-mark ?, asterisk *, or open bracket [ anywhere;
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
\h'-04' 4.\h'+02'It cannot end with a slash /\.
.RE
These rules makes it easy for shell script based tools to parse refnames, pathname expansion by the shell when a refname is used unquoted (by mistake), and also avoids ambiguities in certain refname expressions (see \fBgit-rev-parse\fR(1))\. Namely:

.sp
.RS 4
\h'-04' 1.\h'+02'double\-dot \.\. are often used as in ref1\.\.ref2, and in some context this notation means ^ref1 ref2 (i\.e\. not in ref1 and in ref2)\.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
\h'-04' 2.\h'+02'tilde ~ and caret ^ are used to introduce postfix \fInth parent\fR and \fIpeel onion\fR operation\.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
\h'-04' 3.\h'+02'colon : is used as in srcref:dstref to mean "use srcref\'s value and store it in dstref" in fetch and push operations\. It may also be used to select a specific object such as with \'git\-cat\-file\': "git cat\-file blob v1\.3\.3:refs\.c"\.
