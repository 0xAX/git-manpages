.SH NAME
git-add \- Add files to the index file.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"


\fIgit\-add\fR [\-n] [\-v] [\-\-] <file>...

.SH "DESCRIPTION"


A simple wrapper for git\-update\-index to add files to the index, for people used to do "cvs add"\&.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
<file>...
Files to add to the index\&.

.TP
\-n
Don't actually add the file(s), just show if they exist\&.

.TP
\-v
Be verbose\&.

.TP
--
This option can be used to separate command\-line options from the list of files, (useful when filenames might be mistaken for command\-line options)\&.

.SH "DISCUSSION"


The list of <file> given to the command is fed to git\-ls\-files command to list files that are not registered in the index and are not ignored/excluded by $GIT_DIR/info/exclude file or \&.gitignore file in each directory\&. This means two things:

.TP 3
1.
You can put the name of a directory on the command line, and the command will add all files in it and its subdirectories;
.TP
2.
Giving the name of a file that is already in index does not run git\-update\-index on that path\&.
.LP

.SH "EXAMPLES"

.TP
git\-add Documentation/\\*\&.txt
Adds all *\&.txt files that are not in the index under Documentation directory and its subdirectories\&.

Note that the asterisk * is quoted from the shell in this example; this lets the command to include the files from subdirectories of Documentation/ directory\&.

.TP
git\-add git\-*\&.sh
Adds all git\-*\&.sh scripts that are not in the index\&. Because this example lets shell expand the asterisk (i\&.e\&. you are listing the files explicitly), it does not add subdir/git\-foo\&.sh to the index\&.

.SH "AUTHOR"


Written by Linus Torvalds <torvalds@osdl\&.org>

.SH "DOCUMENTATION"


Documentation by Junio C Hamano and the git\-list <git@vger\&.kernel\&.org>\&.

.SH "GIT"
