.SH "NAME"
git\-get\-tar\-commit\-id \- Extract commit ID from an archive created using git\-tar\-tree
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fIgit\-get\-tar\-commit\-id\fR < <tarfile>
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Acts as a filter, extracting the commit ID stored in archives created by git\-tar\-tree. It reads only the first 1024 bytes of input, thus its runtime is not influenced by the size of <tarfile> very much.

If no commit ID is found, git\-get\-tar\-commit\-id quietly exists with a return code of 1. This can happen if <tarfile> had not been created using git\-tar\-tree or if the first parameter of git\-tar\-tree had been a tree ID instead of a commit ID or tag.
