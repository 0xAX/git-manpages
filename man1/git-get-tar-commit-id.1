.SH NAME
git-get-tar-commit-id \- Extract commit ID from an archive created using git-tar-tree
.SH "SYNOPSIS"


\fIgit\-get\-tar\-commit\-id\fR < <tarfile>

.SH "DESCRIPTION"


Acts as a filter, extracting the commit ID stored in archives created by git\-tar\-tree\&. It reads only the first 1024 bytes of input, thus its runtime is not influenced by the size of <tarfile> very much\&.


If no commit ID is found, git\-get\-tar\-commit\-id quietly exists with a return code of 1\&. This can happen if <tarfile> had not been created using git\-tar\-tree or if the first parameter of git\-tar\-tree had been a tree ID instead of a commit ID or tag\&.

.SH "AUTHOR"


Written by Rene Scharfe <rene\&.scharfe@lsrfire\&.ath\&.cx>

.SH "DOCUMENTATION"


Documentation by Junio C Hamano and the git\-list <git@vger\&.kernel\&.org>\&.

.SH "GIT"


Part of the \fBgit\fR(7) suite
