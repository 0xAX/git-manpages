.SH NAME
git-unpack-objects \- Unpack objects from a packed archive
.SH "SYNOPSIS"


\fIgit\-unpack\-objects\fR [\-n] [\-q] <pack\-file

.SH "DESCRIPTION"


Read a packed archive (\&.pack) from the standard input, expanding the objects contained within and writing them into the repository in "loose" (one object per file) format\&.


Objects that already exist in the repository will \fInot\fR be unpacked from the pack\-file\&. Therefore, nothing will be unpacked if you use this command on a pack\-file that exists within the target repository\&.


Please see the git\-repack documentation for options to generate new packs and replace existing ones\&.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
\-n
Only list the objects that would be unpacked, don't actually unpack them\&.

.TP

The command usually shows percentage progress\&. This flag suppresses it\&.
