.SH NAME
git-cat-file \- Provide content or type information for repository objects
.SH "SYNOPSIS"


git\-cat\-file (\-t | \-s | \-e | <type>) <object>

.SH "DESCRIPTION"


Provides content or type of objects in the repository\&. The type is required unless \-t is used to find the object type, or \-s is used to find the object size\&.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
<object>
The sha1 identifier of the object\&.

.TP
\-t
Instead of the content, show the object type identified by <object>\&.

.TP
\-s
Instead of the content, show the object size identified by <object>\&.

.TP
\-e
Suppress all output; instead exit with zero status if <object> exists and is a valid object\&.

.TP
<type>
Typically this matches the real type of <object> but asking for a type that can trivially be dereferenced from the given <object> is also permitted\&. An example is to ask for a "tree" with <object> being a commit object that contains it, or to ask for a "blob" with <object> being a tag object that points at it\&.

.SH "OUTPUT"


If \-t is specified, one of the <type>\&.


If \-s is specified, the size of the <object> in bytes\&.


If \-e is specified, no output\&.


Otherwise the raw (though uncompressed) contents of the <object> will be returned\&.

.SH "AUTHOR"


Written by Linus Torvalds <torvalds@osdl\&.org>

.SH "DOCUMENTATION"


Documentation by David Greaves, Junio C Hamano and the git\-list <git@vger\&.kernel\&.org>\&.

.SH "GIT"


Part of the \fBgit\fR(7) suite
