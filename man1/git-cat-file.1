.SH "NAME"
git-cat-file - Provide content or type/size information for repository objects
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fIgit cat\-file\fR [\-t | \-s | \-e | \-p | <type>] <object>
\fIgit cat\-file\fR [\-\-batch | \-\-batch\-check] < <list\-of\-objects>
.fi
.RE
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
In the first form, provides content or type of objects in the repository\. The type is required unless \fI\-t\fR or \fI\-p\fR is used to find the object type, or \fI\-s\fR is used to find the object size\.

In the second form, a list of object (separated by LFs) is provided on stdin, and the SHA1, type, and size of each object is printed on stdout\.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
<object>
.RS 4
The name of the object to show\. For a more complete list of ways to spell object names, see "SPECIFYING REVISIONS" section in \fBgit-rev-parse\fR(1)\.
.RE
.PP
\-t
.RS 4
Instead of the content, show the object type identified by <object>\.
.RE
.PP
\-s
.RS 4
Instead of the content, show the object size identified by <object>\.
.RE
.PP
\-e
.RS 4
Suppress all output; instead exit with zero status if <object> exists and is a valid object\.
.RE
.PP
\-p
.RS 4
Pretty\-print the contents of <object> based on its type\.
.RE
.PP
<type>
.RS 4
Typically this matches the real type of <object> but asking for a type that can trivially be dereferenced from the given <object> is also permitted\. An example is to ask for a "tree" with <object> being a commit object that contains it, or to ask for a "blob" with <object> being a tag object that points at it\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-batch
.RS 4
Print the SHA1, type, size, and contents of each object provided on stdin\. May not be combined with any other options or arguments\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-batch\-check
.RS 4
Print the SHA1, type, and size of each object provided on stdin\. May not be combined with any other options or arguments\.
.RE
.SH "OUTPUT"
If \fI\-t\fR is specified, one of the <type>\.

If \fI\-s\fR is specified, the size of the <object> in bytes\.

If \fI\-e\fR is specified, no output\.

If \fI\-p\fR is specified, the contents of <object> are pretty\-printed\.

If <type> is specified, the raw (though uncompressed) contents of the <object> will be returned\.

If \fI\-\-batch\fR is specified, output of the following form is printed for each object specified on stdin:

.sp
.RS 4
.nf

\.ft C
<sha1> SP <type> SP <size> LF
<contents> LF
\.ft

.fi
.RE
If \fI\-\-batch\-check\fR is specified, output of the following form is printed for each object specified on stdin:

.sp
.RS 4
.nf

\.ft C
<sha1> SP <type> SP <size> LF
\.ft

.fi
.RE
For both \fI\-\-batch\fR and \fI\-\-batch\-check\fR, output of the following form is printed for each object specified on stdin that does not exist in the repository:

.sp
.RS 4
.nf

\.ft C
<object> SP missing LF
\.ft
