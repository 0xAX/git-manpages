.SH "NAME"
git\-runstatus \- A helper for git\-status and git\-commit
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fIgit\-runstatus\fR [\-\-color|\-\-nocolor] [\-\-amend] [\-\-verbose] [\-\-untracked]
.sp
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Examines paths in the working tree that has changes unrecorded to the index file, and changes between the index file and the current HEAD commit. The former paths are what you _could_ commit by running \fIgit\-update\-index\fR before running \fIgit commit\fR, and the latter paths are what you _would_ commit by running \fIgit commit\fR.
.sp
If there is no path that is different between the index file and the current HEAD commit, the command exits with non\-zero status.
.sp
Note that this is _not_ the user level command you would want to run from the command line. Use \fIgit\-status\fR instead.
.sp
