.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fIgitk\fR [<option>\&...] [<revs>] [\-\-] [<path>\&...]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Displays changes in a repository or a selected set of commits\. This includes visualizing the commit graph, showing information related to each commit, and the files in the trees of each revision\.

Historically, gitk was the first repository browser\. It\'s written in tcl/tk and started off in a separate repository but was later merged into the main git repository\.
.SH "OPTIONS"
To control which revisions to shown, the command takes options applicable to the \fIgit\-rev\-list\fR command (see \fBgit-rev-list\fR(1))\. This manual page describes only the most frequently used options\.
.PP
\-n <number>, \-\-max\-count=<number>
.RS 4

.RE
.PP

.RS 4

.RE
.PP

.RE
.PP
<revs>
.RS 4
Limit the revisions to show\. This can be either a single revision meaning show from the given revision and back, or it can be a range in the form "\fI<from>\fR\.\.\fI<to>\fR" to show all revisions between \fI<from>\fR and back to \fI<to>\fR\. Note, more advanced revision selection can be applied\. For a more complete list of ways to spell object names, see "SPECIFYING REVISIONS" section in \fBgit-rev-parse\fR(1)\.
.RE
.PP
<path>
.RS 4
Limit commits to the ones touching files in the given paths\. Note, to avoid ambiguity wrt\. revision names use "\-\-" to separate the paths from any preceding options\.
