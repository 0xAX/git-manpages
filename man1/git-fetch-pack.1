.SH "NAME"
git\-fetch\-pack \- Receive missing objects from another repository
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fIgit\-fetch\-pack\fR [\-\-all] [\-\-quiet|\-q] [\-\-keep|\-k] [\-\-thin] [\-\-upload\-pack=<git\-upload\-pack>] [\-\-depth=<n>] [\-\-no\-progress] [\-v] [<host>:]<directory> [<refs>\&...]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Usually you would want to use \fBgit\-fetch\fR(1) which is a higher level wrapper of this command instead.

Invokes \fIgit\-upload\-pack\fR on a potentially remote repository, and asks it to send objects missing from this repository, to update the named heads. The list of commits available locally is found out by scanning local $GIT_DIR/refs/ and sent to \fIgit\-upload\-pack\fR running on the other end.

This command degenerates to download everything to complete the asked refs from the remote side when the local side does not have a common ancestor commit.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\-\-all
Fetch all remote refs.
.TP
\-\-quiet, \\\-q
Pass \fI\-q\fR flag to \fIgit\-unpack\-objects\fR; this makes the cloning process less verbose.
.TP
\-\-keep, \\\-k
Do not invoke \fIgit\-unpack\-objects\fR on received data, but create a single packfile out of it instead, and store it in the object database. If provided twice then the pack is locked against repacking.
.TP
\-\-thin
Spend extra cycles to minimize the number of objects to be sent. Use it on slower connection.
.TP
\-\-upload\-pack=<git\-upload\-pack>
Use this to specify the path to \fIgit\-upload\-pack\fR on the remote side, if is not found on your $PATH. Installations of sshd ignores the user's environment setup scripts for login shells (e.g. .bash_profile) and your privately installed git may not be found on the system default $PATH. Another workaround suggested is to set up your $PATH in ".bashrc", but this flag is for people who do not want to pay the overhead for non\-interactive shells by having a lean .bashrc file (they set most of the things up in .bash_profile).
.TP
\-\-exec=<git\-upload\-pack>
Same as \-\-upload\-pack=<git\-upload\-pack>.
.TP
\-\-depth=<n>
Limit fetching to ancestor\-chains not longer than n.
.TP
\-\-no\-progress
Do not show the progress.
.TP
\\\-v
Run verbosely.
.TP
<host>
A remote host that houses the repository. When this part is specified, \fIgit\-upload\-pack\fR is invoked via ssh.
.TP
<directory>
The repository to sync from.
.TP
<refs>\&...
The remote heads to update from. This is relative to $GIT_DIR (e.g. "HEAD", "refs/heads/master"). When unspecified, update from all heads the remote side has.
