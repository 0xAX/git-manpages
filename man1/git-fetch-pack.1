.SH NAME
git-fetch-pack \- Receive missing objects from another repository.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"


\fIgit\-fetch\-pack\fR [\-q] [\-k] [\-\-exec=<git\-upload\-pack>] [<host>:]<directory> [<refs>...]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"


Invokes \fIgit\-upload\-pack\fR on a potentially remote repository, and asks it to send objects missing from this repository, to update the named heads\&. The list of commits available locally is found out by scanning local $GIT_DIR/refs/ and sent to \fIgit\-upload\-pack\fR running on the other end\&.


This command degenerates to download everything to complete the asked refs from the remote side when the local side does not have a common ancestor commit\&.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
\-q
Pass \fI\-q\fR flag to \fIgit\-unpack\-objects\fR; this makes the cloning process less verbose\&.

.TP
\-k
Do not invoke \fIgit\-unpack\-objects\fR on received data, but create a single packfile out of it instead, and store it in the object database\&.

.TP
\-\-exec=<git\-upload\-pack>
Use this to specify the path to \fIgit\-upload\-pack\fR on the remote side, if is not found on your $PATH\&. Installations of sshd ignores the user's environment setup scripts for login shells (e\&.g\&. \&.bash_profile) and your privately installed git may not be found on the system default $PATH\&. Another workaround suggested is to set up your $PATH in "\&.bashrc", but this flag is for people who do not want to pay the overhead for non\-interactive shells by having a lean \&.bashrc file (they set most of the things up in \&.bash_profile)\&.

.TP
<host>
A remote host that houses the repository\&. When this part is specified, \fIgit\-upload\-pack\fR is invoked via ssh\&.

.TP
<directory>
The repository to sync from\&.

.TP
<refs>...
The remote heads to update from\&. This is relative to $GIT_DIR (e\&.g\&. "HEAD", "refs/heads/master")\&. When unspecified, update from all heads the remote side has\&.
