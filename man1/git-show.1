.SH "NAME"
git-show - Show various types of objects
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fIgit show\fR [options] <object>\&...
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Shows one or more objects (blobs, trees, tags and commits)\.

For commits it shows the log message and textual diff\. It also presents the merge commit in a special format as produced by \fIgit\-diff\-tree \-\-cc\fR\.

For tags, it shows the tag message and the referenced objects\.

For trees, it shows the names (equivalent to \fIgit\-ls\-tree\fR with \-\-name\-only)\.

For plain blobs, it shows the plain contents\.

The command takes options applicable to the \fIgit\-diff\-tree\fR command to control how the changes the commit introduces are shown\.

This manual page describes only the most frequently used options\.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
<object>\&...
.RS 4
The names of objects to show\. For a more complete list of ways to spell object names, see "SPECIFYING REVISIONS" section in \fBgit-rev-parse\fR(1)\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-pretty[=\fI<format>\fR]
.RS 4
Pretty\-print the contents of the commit logs in a given format, where \fI<format>\fR can be one of \fIoneline\fR, \fIshort\fR, \fImedium\fR, \fIfull\fR, \fIfuller\fR, \fIemail\fR, \fIraw\fR and \fIformat:<string>\fR\. When omitted, the format defaults to \fImedium\fR\.

Note: you can specify the default pretty format in the repository configuration (see \fBgit-config\fR(1))\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-abbrev\-commit
.RS 4
Instead of showing the full 40\-byte hexadecimal commit object name, show only a partial prefix\. Non default number of digits can be specified with "\-\-abbrev=<n>" (which also modifies diff output, if it is displayed)\.

This should make "\-\-pretty=oneline" a whole lot more readable for people using 80\-column terminals\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-encoding[=<encoding>]
.RS 4
The commit objects record the encoding used for the log message in their encoding header; this option can be used to tell the command to re\-code the commit log message in the encoding preferred by the user\. For non plumbing commands this defaults to UTF\-8\.
.RE
.SH "PRETTY FORMATS"
If the commit is a merge, and if the pretty\-format is not \fIoneline\fR, \fIemail\fR or \fIraw\fR, an additional line is inserted before the \fIAuthor:\fR line\. This line begins with "Merge: " and the sha1s of ancestral commits are printed, separated by spaces\. Note that the listed commits may not necessarily be the list of the \fBdirect\fR parent commits if you have limited your view of history: for example, if you are only interested in changes related to a certain directory or file\.

Here are some additional details for each format:

\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\fIraw\fR

The \fIraw\fR format shows the entire commit exactly as stored in the commit object\. Notably, the SHA1s are displayed in full, regardless of whether \-\-abbrev or \-\-no\-abbrev are used, and \fIparents\fR information show the true parent commits, without taking grafts nor history simplification into account\.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\fIformat:\fR

The \fIformat:\fR format allows you to specify which information you want to show\. It works a little bit like printf format, with the notable exception that you get a newline with \fI%n\fR instead of \fI\en\fR\.

E\.g, \fIformat:"The author of %h was %an, %ar%nThe title was >>%s<<%n"\fR would show something like this:

\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\fItformat:\fR

The \fItformat:\fR format works exactly like \fIformat:\fR, except that it provides "terminator" semantics instead of "separator" semantics\. In other words, each commit has the message terminator character (usually a newline) appended, rather than a separator placed between entries\. This means that the final entry of a single\-line format will be properly terminated with a new line, just as the "oneline" format does\. For example:

.sp
.RS 4
.nf

\.ft C
$ git log \-2 \-\-pretty=format:%h 4da45bef \e
  | perl \-pe \'$_ \.= " \-\- NO NEWLINE\en" unless /\en/\'
4da45be

$ git log \-2 \-\-pretty=tformat:%h 4da45bef \e

At the core level, git is character encoding agnostic\.

.sp
.RS 4
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'The pathnames recorded in the index and in the tree objects are treated as uninterpreted sequences of non\-NUL bytes\. What readdir(2) returns are what are recorded and compared with the data git keeps track of, which in turn are expected to be what lstat(2) and creat(2) accepts\. There is no such thing as pathname encoding translation\.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'The contents of the blob objects are uninterpreted sequences of bytes\. There is no encoding translation at the core level\.
.RE

.RS 4
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'The commit log messages are uninterpreted sequences of non\-NUL bytes\.
.RE
Although we encourage that the commit log messages are encoded in UTF\-8, both the core and git Porcelain are designed not to force UTF\-8 on projects\. If all participants of a particular project find it more convenient to use legacy encodings, git does not forbid it\. However, there are a few things to keep in mind\.

.sp
.RS 4
\h'-04' 1.\h'+02'\fIgit\-commit\fR and \fIgit\-commit\-tree\fR issues a warning if the commit log message given to it does not look like a valid UTF\-8 string, unless you explicitly say your project uses a legacy encoding\. The way to say this is to have i18n\.commitencoding in \.git/config file, like this:

.sp
.RS 4
.nf

\.ft C
[i18n]
        commitencoding = ISO\-8859\-1
\.ft

.fi
.RE
Commit objects created with the above setting record the value of i18n\.commitencoding in its encoding header\. This is to help other people who look at them later\. Lack of this header implies that the commit log message is encoded in UTF\-8\.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
\h'-04' 2.\h'+02'\fIgit\-log\fR, \fIgit\-show\fR, \fIgit\-blame\fR and friends look at the encoding header of a commit object, and try to re\-code the log message into UTF\-8 unless otherwise specified\. You can specify the desired output encoding with i18n\.logoutputencoding in \.git/config file, like this:

.sp
.RS 4
.nf

\.ft C
[i18n]
        logoutputencoding = ISO\-8859\-1
\.ft

.fi
.RE
If you do not have this configuration variable, the value of i18n\.commitencoding is used instead\.
.RE
Note that we deliberately chose not to re\-code the commit log message when a commit is made to force UTF\-8 at the commit object level, because re\-coding to UTF\-8 is not necessarily a reversible operation\.
