.SH NAME
git-merge-tree \- Show three-way merge without touching index
.SH "SYNOPSIS"


\fIgit\-merge\-tree\fR <base\-tree> <branch1> <branch2>

.SH "DESCRIPTION"


Reads three treeish, and output trivial merge results and conflicting stages to the standard output\&. This is similar to what three\-way read\-tree \-m does, but instead of storing the results in the index, the command outputs the entries to the standard output\&.


This is meant to be used by higher level scripts to compute merge results outside index, and stuff the results back into the index\&. For this reason, the output from the command omits entries that match <branch1> tree\&.

Documentation by Junio C Hamano and the git\-list <git@vger\&.kernel\&.org>\&.
