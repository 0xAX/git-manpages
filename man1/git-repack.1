.SH NAME
git-repack \- Script used to pack a repository from a collection of objects into pack files.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"


\fIgit\-repack\fR [\-a] [\-d] [\-f] [\-l] [\-n] [\-q]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"


This script is used to combine all objects that do not currently reside in a "pack", into a pack\&.


A pack is a collection of objects, individually compressed, with delta compression applied, stored in a single file, with an associated index file\&.


Packs are used to reduce the load on mirror systems, backup engines, disk storage, etc\&.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
\-a
Instead of incrementally packing the unpacked objects, pack everything available into a single pack\&. Especially useful when packing a repository that is used for a private development and there no need to worry about people fetching via dumb protocols from it\&. Use with \fI\-d\fR\&.

.TP
\-d
After packing, if the newly created packs make some existing packs redundant, remove the redundant packs\&.

.TP
\-l
Pass the \-\-local option to git pack\-objects, see \fBgit\-pack\-objects\fR(1)\&.

.TP
\-f
Pass the \-\-no\-reuse\-delta option to git pack\-objects, see \fBgit\-pack\-objects\fR(1)\&.

.TP
\-q
Pass the \-q option to git pack\-objects, see \fBgit\-pack\-objects\fR(1)\&.

.TP
\-n
Do not update the server information with git update\-server\-info\&.
