.SH "NAME"
git\-repack \- Pack unpacked objects in a repository
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fIgit\-repack\fR [\-a] [\-d] [\-f] [\-l] [\-n] [\-q] [\-\-window=N] [\-\-depth=N]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This script is used to combine all objects that do not currently reside in a "pack", into a pack.

A pack is a collection of objects, individually compressed, with delta compression applied, stored in a single file, with an associated index file.

Packs are used to reduce the load on mirror systems, backup engines, disk storage, etc.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\-a
Instead of incrementally packing the unpacked objects, pack everything available into a single pack. Especially useful when packing a repository that is used for private development and there is no need to worry about people fetching via dumb file transfer protocols from it. Use with \fI\-d\fR.
.TP
\-d
After packing, if the newly created packs make some existing packs redundant, remove the redundant packs. Also runs \fBgit\-prune\-packed\fR(1).
.TP
\-l
Pass the \-\-local option to git pack\-objects, see \fBgit\-pack\-objects\fR(1).
.TP
\-f
Pass the \-\-no\-reuse\-delta option to git pack\-objects, see \fBgit\-pack\-objects\fR(1).
.TP
\-q
Pass the \-q option to git pack\-objects, see \fBgit\-pack\-objects\fR(1).
.TP
\-n
Do not update the server information with git update\-server\-info.
.TP
\-\-window=[N], \-\-depth=[N]
These two options affect how the objects contained in the pack are stored using delta compression. The objects are first internally sorted by type, size and optionally names and compared against the other objects within \-\-window to see if using delta compression saves space. \-\-depth limits the maximum delta depth; making it too deep affects the performance on the unpacker side, because delta data needs to be applied that many times to get to the necessary object. The default value for both \-\-window and \-\-depth is 10.
.SH "CONFIGURATION"
When configuration variable repack.UseDeltaBaseOffset is set for the repository, the command passes \-\-delta\-base\-offset option to git\-pack\-objects; this typically results in slightly smaller packs, but the generated packs are incompatible with versions of git older than (and including) v1.4.3; do not set the variable in a repository that older version of git needs to be able to read (this includes repositories from which packs can be copied out over http or rsync, and people who obtained packs that way can try to use older git with it).
