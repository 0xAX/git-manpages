.SH NAME
git-am \- Apply a series of patches in a mailbox
.SH "SYNOPSIS"

.nf
git\-am [\-\-signoff] [\-\-dotest=<dir>] [\-\-utf8] [\-\-binary] [\-\-3way] <mbox>...
git\-am [\-\-skip | \-\-resolved]
.fi

.SH "DESCRIPTION"


Splits mail messages in a mailbox into commit log message, authorship information and patches, and applies them to the current branch\&.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
\-\-signoff
Add Signed\-off\-by: line to the commit message, using the committer identity of yourself\&.

.TP
\-\-dotest=<dir>
Instead of \&.dotest directory, use <dir> as a working area to store extracted patches\&.

.TP
\-\-utf8, \-\-keep
Pass \-u and \-k flags to git\-mailinfo (see \fBgit\-mailinfo\fR(1))\&.

.TP
\-\-binary
Pass \-\-allow\-binary\-replacement flag to git\-apply (see \fBgit\-apply\fR(1))\&.

.TP
\-\-3way
When the patch does not apply cleanly, fall back on 3\-way merge, if the patch records the identity of blobs it is supposed to apply to, and we have those blobs locally\&.

.TP
\-\-skip
Skip the current patch\&. This is only meaningful when restarting an aborted patch\&.

.TP
\-\-interactive
Run interactively, just like git\-applymbox\&.

.TP
\-\-resolved
After a patch failure (e\&.g\&. attempting to apply conflicting patch), the user has applied it by hand and the index file stores the result of the application\&. Make a commit using the authorship and commit log extracted from the e\-mail message and the current index file, and continue\&.

.SH "DISCUSSION"


When initially invoking it, you give it names of the mailboxes to crunch\&. Upon seeing the first patch that does not apply, it aborts in the middle, just like git\-applymbox does\&. You can recover from this in one of two ways:

.TP 3
1.
skip the current one by re\-running the command with \-\-skip option\&.
.TP
2.
hand resolve the conflict in the working directory, and update the index file to bring it in a state that the patch should have produced\&. Then run the command with \-\-resolved option\&.
.LP


The command refuses to process new mailboxes while \&.dotest directory exists, so if you decide to start over from scratch, run rm \-f \&.dotest before running the command with mailbox names\&.
