.SH "NAME"
git\-am \- Apply a series of patches in a mailbox
.SH "SYNOPSIS"

.nf
\fIgit\-am\fR [\-\-signoff] [\-\-dotest=<dir>] [\-\-utf8] [\-\-binary] [\-\-3way]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Splits mail messages in a mailbox into commit log message, authorship information and patches, and applies them to the current branch.
.sp
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\-\-signoff
Add
Signed\-off\-by:
line to the commit message, using the committer identity of yourself.
.TP
\-\-dotest=<dir>
Instead of
.dotest
directory, use <dir> as a working area to store extracted patches.
.TP
\-\-utf8, \-\-keep
Pass
\-u
and
\-k
flags to
git\-mailinfo
(see
\fBgit\-mailinfo\fR(1)).
.TP
\-\-binary
Pass
\-\-allow\-binary\-replacement
flag to
git\-apply
(see
\fBgit\-apply\fR(1)).
.TP
\-\-3way
When the patch does not apply cleanly, fall back on 3\-way merge, if the patch records the identity of blobs it is supposed to apply to, and we have those blobs locally.
.TP
\-\-skip
Skip the current patch. This is only meaningful when restarting an aborted patch.
.TP
\-\-whitespace=<option>
This flag is passed to the
git\-apply
program that applies the patch.
.TP
\-\-interactive
Run interactively, just like git\-applymbox.
.TP
\-\-resolved
After a patch failure (e.g. attempting to apply conflicting patch), the user has applied it by hand and the index file stores the result of the application. Make a commit using the authorship and commit log extracted from the e\-mail message and the current index file, and continue.
.SH "DISCUSSION"
When initially invoking it, you give it names of the mailboxes to crunch. Upon seeing the first patch that does not apply, it aborts in the middle, just like \fIgit\-applymbox\fR does. You can recover from this in one of two ways:
.sp
.TP 3
1.
skip the current one by re\-running the command with
\fI\-\-skip\fR
option.
.TP
2.
hand resolve the conflict in the working directory, and update the index file to bring it in a state that the patch should have produced. Then run the command with
\fI\-\-resolved\fR
option.
The command refuses to process new mailboxes while .dotest directory exists, so if you decide to start over from scratch, run rm \-f .dotest before running the command with mailbox names.
