.SH NAME
git-whatchanged \- Show logs with difference each commit introduces.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"


git\-whatchanged <option>...

.SH "DESCRIPTION"


Shows commit logs and diff output each commit introduces\&. The command internally invokes git\-rev\-list piped to git\-diff\-tree, and takes command line options for both of these commands\&.


This manual page describes only the most frequently used options\&.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
\-p
Show textual diffs, instead of the git internal diff output format that is useful only to tell the changed paths and their nature of changes\&.

.TP
\-\-max\-count=<n>
Limit output to <n> commits\&.

.TP
<since>\&.\&.<until>
Limit output to between the two named commits (bottom exclusive, top inclusive)\&.

.TP
\-r
Show git internal diff output, but for the whole tree, not just the top level\&.

.TP
\-\-pretty=<format>
Controls the output format for the commit logs\&. <format> can be one of raw, medium, short, full, and oneline\&.

.TP
\-m
By default, differences for merge commits are not shown\&. With this flag, show differences to that commit from all of its parents\&.

.nf
However, it is not very useful in general, although it
*is* useful on a file\-by\-file basis\&.
.fi

.SH "EXAMPLES"

.TP
git\-whatchanged \-p v2\&.6\&.12\&.\&. include/scsi drivers/scsi
