.SH "NAME"
git\-whatchanged \- Show logs with difference each commit introduces
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fIgit\-whatchanged\fR <option>\&...
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Shows commit logs and diff output each commit introduces. The command internally invokes \fIgit\-rev\-list\fR piped to \fIgit\-diff\-tree\fR, and takes command line options for both of these commands.

This manual page describes only the most frequently used options.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\-p
Show textual diffs, instead of the git internal diff output format that is useful only to tell the changed paths and their nature of changes.
.TP
\-<n>
Limit output to <n> commits.
.TP
<since>..<until>
Limit output to between the two named commits (bottom exclusive, top inclusive).
.TP
\-r
Show git internal diff output, but for the whole tree, not just the top level.
.TP
\-\-pretty=<format>
Controls the output format for the commit logs. <format> can be one of \fIraw\fR, \fImedium\fR, \fIshort\fR, \fIfull\fR, and \fIoneline\fR.
.TP
\-m
By default, differences for merge commits are not shown. With this flag, show differences to that commit from all of its parents.

However, it is not very useful in general, although it \fBis\fR useful on a file\-by\-file basis.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.TP
git\-whatchanged \-p v2.6.12.. include/scsi drivers/scsi
Show as patches the commits since version \fIv2.6.12\fR that changed any file in the include/scsi or drivers/scsi subdirectories
.TP
git\-whatchanged \-\-since="2 weeks ago" \-\- gitk
Show the changes during the last two weeks to the file \fIgitk\fR. The "\-\-" is necessary to avoid confusion with the \fBbranch\fR named \fIgitk\fR
