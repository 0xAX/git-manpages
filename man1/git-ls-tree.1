git-ls-tree - List the contents of a tree object

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Lists the contents of a given tree object, like what "/bin/ls \-a" does in the current working directory\. Note that:

.sp
.RS 4
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'the behaviour is slightly different from that of "/bin/ls" in that the \fIpaths\fR denote just a list of patterns to match, e\.g\. so specifying directory name (without \fI\-r\fR) will behave differently, and order of the arguments does not matter\.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'the behaviour is similar to that of "/bin/ls" in that the \fIpaths\fR is taken as relative to the current working directory\. E\.g\. when you are in a directory \fIsub\fR that has a directory \fIdir\fR, you can run \fIgit ls\-tree \-r HEAD dir\fR to list the contents of the tree (that is \fIsub/dir\fR in \fIHEAD\fR)\. You don\'t want to give a tree that is not at the root level (e\.g\. \fIgit ls\-tree \-r HEAD:sub dir\fR) in this case, as that would result in asking for \fIsub/sub/dir\fR in the \fIHEAD\fR commit\.
.RE
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
<tree\-ish>
.RS 4
Id of a tree\-ish\.
.RE
.PP
\-d
.RS 4
Show only the named tree entry itself, not its children\.
.RE
.PP
\-r
.RS 4
Recurse into sub\-trees\.
.RE
.PP
\-t
.RS 4
Show tree entries even when going to recurse them\. Has no effect if \fI\-r\fR was not passed\. \fI\-d\fR implies \fI\-t\fR\.
.RE
.PP
\-l, \-\-long
.RS 4
Show object size of blob (file) entries\.
.RE
.PP
\-z
.RS 4
\e0 line termination on output\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-name\-only, \-\-name\-status
.RS 4
List only filenames (instead of the "long" output), one per line\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-abbrev[=<n>]
.RS 4
Instead of showing the full 40\-byte hexadecimal object lines, show only a partial prefix\. Non default number of digits can be specified with \-\-abbrev=<n>\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-full\-name
.RS 4
Instead of showing the path names relative to the current working directory, show the full path names\.
.RE
.PP
paths
.RS 4
When paths are given, show them (note that this isn\'t really raw pathnames, but rather a list of patterns to match)\. Otherwise implicitly uses the root level of the tree as the sole path argument\.
.RE
.SH "OUTPUT FORMAT"
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
<mode> SP <type> SP <object> TAB <file>
.fi
.RE
When the \-z option is not used, TAB, LF, and backslash characters in pathnames are represented as \et, \en, and \e\e, respectively\.

When the \-l option is used, format changes to

.sp
.RS 4
.nf
<mode> SP <type> SP <object> SP <object size> TAB <file>
.fi
.RE
Object size identified by <object> is given in bytes, and right\-justified with minimum width of 7 characters\. Object size is given only for blobs (file) entries; for other entries \- character is used in place of size\.
