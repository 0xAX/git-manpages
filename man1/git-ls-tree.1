.SH NAME
git-ls-tree \- Lists the contents of a tree object
.SH "SYNOPSIS"


\fIgit\-ls\-tree\fR [\-d] [\-r] [\-t] [\-z] [\-\-name\-only] [\-\-name\-status] <tree\-ish> [paths...]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"


Lists the contents of a given tree object, like what "/bin/ls \-a" does in the current working directory\&. Note that the usage is subtly different, though \- \fIpaths\fR denote just a list of patterns to match, e\&.g\&. so specifying directory name (without \fI\-r\fR) will behave differently, and order of the arguments does not matter\&.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
<tree\-ish>
Id of a tree\-ish\&.

.TP
\-d
Show only the named tree entry itself, not its children\&.

.TP
\-r
Recurse into sub\-trees\&.

.TP
\-t
Show tree entries even when going to recurse them\&. Has no effect if \fI\-r\fR was not passed\&. \fI\-d\fR implies \fI\-t\fR\&.

.TP
\-z
\\0 line termination on output\&.

.TP
\-\-name\-only, \-\-name\-status
List only filenames (instead of the "long" output), one per line\&.

.TP
paths
When paths are given, show them (note that this isn't really raw pathnames, but rather a list of patterns to match)\&. Otherwise implicitly uses the root level of the tree as the sole path argument\&.

.SH "OUTPUT FORMAT"

.nf
<mode> SP <type> SP <object> TAB <file>
.fi


When the \-z option is not used, TAB, LF, and backslash characters in pathnames are represented as \\t, \\n, and \\\\, respectively\&.
