.SH NAME
git-clone-pack \- Clones a repository by receiving packed objects
.SH "SYNOPSIS"


\fIgit\-clone\-pack\fR [\-\-exec=<git\-upload\-pack>] [<host>:]<directory> [<head>...]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"


Clones a repository into the current repository by invoking \fIgit\-upload\-pack\fR, possibly on the remote host via ssh, in the named repository, and stores the sent pack in the local repository\&.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
\-\-exec=<git\-upload\-pack>
Use this to specify the path to \fIgit\-upload\-pack\fR on the remote side, if it is not found on your $PATH\&. Installations of sshd ignore the user's environment setup scripts for login shells (e\&.g\&. \&.bash_profile) and your privately installed git may not be found on the system default $PATH\&. Another workaround suggested is to set up your $PATH in "\&.bashrc", but this flag is for people who do not want to pay the overhead for non\-interactive shells by having a lean \&.bashrc file (they set most of the things up in \&.bash_profile)\&.

.TP
<host>
A remote host that houses the repository\&. When this part is specified, \fIgit\-upload\-pack\fR is invoked via ssh\&.

.TP
<directory>
The repository to sync from\&.

.TP
<head>...
The heads to update\&. This is relative to $GIT_DIR (e\&.g\&. "HEAD", "refs/heads/master")\&. When unspecified, all heads are updated to match the remote repository\&.

Usually all the refs from existing repository are stored under the same name in the new repository\&. Giving explicit <head> arguments instead writes the object names and refs to the standard output, just like get\-fetch\-pack does\&.
