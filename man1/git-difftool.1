.SH "NAME"
git-difftool - Show changes using common diff tools
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fIgit difftool\fR [\-\-tool=<tool>] [\-y|\-\-no\-prompt|\-\-prompt] [<\fIgit diff\fR options>]
.sp
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fIgit\-difftool\fR is a git command that allows you to compare and edit files between revisions using common diff tools\. \fIgit difftool\fR is a frontend to \fIgit\-diff\fR and accepts the same options and arguments\.
.sp
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-y, \-\-no\-prompt
.RS 4
Do not prompt before launching a diff tool\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-prompt
.RS 4
Prompt before each invocation of the diff tool\. This is the default behaviour; the option is provided to override any configuration settings\.
.RE
.PP
\-t <tool>, \-\-tool=<tool>
.RS 4
Use the diff tool specified by <tool>\. Valid merge tools are: kdiff3, kompare, tkdiff, meld, xxdiff, emerge, vimdiff, gvimdiff, ecmerge, diffuse, opendiff and araxis\.
.sp
If a diff tool is not specified,
\fIgit\-difftool\fR
will use the configuration variable
diff\.tool\. If the configuration variable
diff\.tool
is not set,
\fIgit\-difftool\fR
will pick a suitable default\.
.sp
You can explicitly provide a full path to the tool by setting the configuration variable
difftool\.<tool>\.path\. For example, you can configure the absolute path to kdiff3 by setting
difftool\.kdiff3\.path\. Otherwise,
\fIgit\-difftool\fR
assumes the tool is available in PATH\.
.sp
Instead of running one of the known diff tools,
\fIgit\-difftool\fR
can be customized to run an alternative program by specifying the command line to invoke in a configuration variable
difftool\.<tool>\.cmd\.
.sp
When
\fIgit\-difftool\fR
is invoked with this tool (either through the
\-t
or
\-\-tool
option or the
diff\.tool
configuration variable) the configured command line will be invoked with the following variables available:
$LOCAL
is set to the name of the temporary file containing the contents of the diff pre\-image and
$REMOTE
is set to the name of the temporary file containing the contents of the diff post\-image\.
$BASE
is provided for compatibility with custom merge tool commands and has the same value as
$LOCAL\.
.RE
See \fBgit-diff\fR(1) for the full list of supported options\.
.sp
.SH "CONFIG VARIABLES"
\fIgit\-difftool\fR falls back to \fIgit\-mergetool\fR config variables when the difftool equivalents have not been defined\.
.PP
diff\.tool
.RS 4
The default diff tool to use\.
.RE
.PP
difftool\.<tool>\.path
.RS 4
Override the path for the given tool\. This is useful in case your tool is not in the PATH\.
.RE
.PP
difftool\.<tool>\.cmd
.RS 4
Specify the command to invoke the specified diff tool\.
.sp
See the
\-\-tool=<tool>
option above for more details\.
.RE
.PP
difftool\.prompt
.RS 4
Prompt before each invocation of the diff tool\.
.RE
