.SH NAME
git-applymbox \- Apply a series of patches in a mailbox
.SH "SYNOPSIS"


git\-applymbox [\-u] [\-k] [\-q] [\-m] ( \-c \&.dotest/<num> | <mbox> ) [ <signoff> ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"


Splits mail messages in a mailbox into commit log message, authorship information and patches, and applies them to the current branch\&.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
\-q
Apply patches interactively\&. The user will be given opportunity to edit the log message and the patch before attempting to apply it\&.

.TP
\-k
Usually the program cleans up the Subject: header line to extract the title line for the commit log message, among which (1) remove Re: or re:, (2) leading whitespaces, (3) [ up to ], typically [PATCH], and then prepends "[PATCH] "\&. This flag forbids this munging, and is most useful when used to read back git format\-patch \-\-mbox output\&.

.TP
\-m
Patches are applied with git\-apply command, and unless it cleanly applies without fuzz, the processing fails\&. With this flag, if a tree that the patch applies cleanly is found in a repository, the patch is applied to the tree and then a 3\-way merge between the resulting tree and the current tree\&.

.TP
\-u
By default, the commit log message, author name and author email are taken from the e\-mail without any charset conversion, after minimally decoding MIME transfer encoding\&. This flag causes the resulting commit to be encoded in utf\-8 by transliterating them\&. Note that the patch is always used as is without charset conversion, even with this flag\&.

.TP
\-c \&.dotest/<num>
When the patch contained in an e\-mail does not cleanly apply, the command exits with an error message\&. The patch and extracted message are found in \&.dotest/, and you could re\-run git applymbox with \-c \&.dotest/<num> flag to restart the process after inspecting and fixing them\&.

.TP
<mbox>
The name of the file that contains the e\-mail messages with patches\&. This file should be in the UNIX mailbox format\&. See SubmittingPatches document to learn about the formatting convention for e\-mail submission\&.

.TP
<signoff>
The name of the file that contains your "Signed\-off\-by" line\&. See SubmittingPatches document to learn what "Signed\-off\-by" line means\&. You can also just say yes, true, me, or please to use an automatically generated "Signed\-off\-by" line based on your committer identity\&.
