.SH "DESCRIPTION"


Look for specified patterns in the working tree files, blobs registered in the index file, or given tree objects\&.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
\-\-cached
Instead of searching in the working tree files, check the blobs registerd in the index file\&.

.TP
\-a | \-\-text
Process binary files as if they were text\&.

.TP
\-i | \-\-ignore\-case
Ignore case differences between the patterns and the files\&.

.TP
\-w | \-\-word\-regexp
Match the pattern only at word boundary (either begin at the beginning of a line, or preceded by a non\-word character; end at the end of a line or followed by a non\-word character)\&.

.TP
\-v | \-\-invert\-match
Select non\-matching lines\&.

.TP
\-E | \-\-extended\-regexp | \-G | \-\-basic\-regexp
Use POSIX extended/basic regexp for patterns\&. Default is to use basic regexp\&.

.TP
\-n
Prefix the line number to matching lines\&.

.TP
\-l | \-\-files\-with\-matches | \-L | \-\-files\-without\-match
Instead of showing every matched line, show only the names of files that contain (or do not contain) matches\&.

.TP
\-c | \-\-count
Instead of showing every matched line, show the number of lines that match\&.

.TP
\-[ABC] <context>
Show context trailing (A -- after), or leading (B -- before), or both (C -- context) lines, and place a line containing \-\- between continguous groups of matches\&.

.TP
\-f <file>
Read patterns from <file>, one per line\&.

.TP
<tree>...
Search blobs in the trees for specified patterns\&.

.TP
\-\-
Signals the end of options; the rest of the parameters are <path> limiters\&.
