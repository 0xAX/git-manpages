.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Look for specified patterns in the working tree files, blobs registered in the index file, or given tree objects\.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-\-cached
.RS 4
Instead of searching in the working tree files, check the blobs registered in the index file\.
.RE
.PP
\-a, \-\-text
.RS 4
Process binary files as if they were text\.
.RE
.PP
\-i, \-\-ignore\-case
.RS 4
Ignore case differences between the patterns and the files\.
.RE
.PP
\-I
.RS 4
Don\'t match the pattern in binary files\.
.RE
.PP
\-w, \-\-word\-regexp
.RS 4
Match the pattern only at word boundary (either begin at the beginning of a line, or preceded by a non\-word character; end at the end of a line or followed by a non\-word character)\.
.RE
.PP
\-v, \-\-invert\-match
.RS 4
Select non\-matching lines\.
.RE
.PP
\-h, \-H
.RS 4
By default, the command shows the filename for each match\. \-h option is used to suppress this output\. \-H is there for completeness and does not do anything except it overrides \-h given earlier on the command line\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-full\-name
.RS 4
When run from a subdirectory, the command usually outputs paths relative to the current directory\. This option forces paths to be output relative to the project top directory\.
.RE
.PP
\-E, \-\-extended\-regexp, \-G, \-\-basic\-regexp
.RS 4
Use POSIX extended/basic regexp for patterns\. Default is to use basic regexp\.
.RE
.PP
\-F, \-\-fixed\-strings
.RS 4
Use fixed strings for patterns (don\'t interpret pattern as a regex)\.
.RE
.PP
\-n
.RS 4
Prefix the line number to matching lines\.
.RE
.PP
\-l, \-\-files\-with\-matches, \-\-name\-only, \-L, \-\-files\-without\-match
.RS 4
Instead of showing every matched line, show only the names of files that contain (or do not contain) matches\. For better compatibility with \fIgit\-diff\fR, \-\-name\-only is a synonym for \-\-files\-with\-matches\.
.RE
.PP
\-z, \-\-null
.RS 4
Output \e0 instead of the character that normally follows a file name\.
.RE
.PP
\-c, \-\-count
.RS 4
Instead of showing every matched line, show the number of lines that match\.
.RE
.PP
\-[ABC] <context>
.RS 4
Show context trailing (A \(em after), or leading (B \(em before), or both (C \(em context) lines, and place a line containing \-\- between contiguous groups of matches\.
.RE
.PP
\-<num>
.RS 4
A shortcut for specifying \-C<num>\.
.RE
.PP
\-f <file>
.RS 4
Read patterns from <file>, one per line\.
.RE
.PP
\-e
.RS 4
The next parameter is the pattern\. This option has to be used for patterns starting with \- and should be used in scripts passing user input to grep\. Multiple patterns are combined by \fIor\fR\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-and, \-\-or, \-\-not, ( \&... )
.RS 4
Specify how multiple patterns are combined using Boolean expressions\. \-\-or is the default operator\. \-\-and has higher precedence than \-\-or\. \-e has to be used for all patterns\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-all\-match
.RS 4
When giving multiple pattern expressions combined with \-\-or, this flag is specified to limit the match to files that have lines to match all of them\.
.RE
.PP
<tree>\&...
.RS 4
Search blobs in the trees for specified patterns\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-
.RS 4
Signals the end of options; the rest of the parameters are <path> limiters\.
.RE
.SH "EXAMPLE"
.PP
git grep \-e \'#define\' \-\-and \e( \-e MAX_PATH \-e PATH_MAX \e)
.RS 4
Looks for a line that has #define and either MAX_PATH or PATH_MAX\.
.RE
.PP
git grep \-\-all\-match \-e NODE \-e Unexpected
.RS 4
Looks for a line that has NODE or Unexpected in files that have lines that match both\.
.RE
.SH "AUTHOR"
Originally written by Linus Torvalds <torvalds@osdl\.org>, later revamped by Junio C Hamano\.
.SH "DOCUMENTATION"
Documentation by Junio C Hamano and the git\-list <git@vger\.kernel\.org>\.
.SH "GIT"
Part of the \fBgit\fR(1) suite
