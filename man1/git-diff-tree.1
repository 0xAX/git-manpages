.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Compares the content and mode of the blobs found via two tree objects\.

If there is only one <tree\-ish> given, the commit is compared with its parents (see \-\-stdin below)\.

Note that \fIgit\-diff\-tree\fR can use the tree encapsulated in a commit object\.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-p
.RS 4
Generate patch (see section on generating patches)\.
.RE
.PP
\-u
.RS 4
Synonym for "\-p"\.
.RE
.PP
\-U<n>
.RS 4
Shorthand for "\-\-unified=<n>"\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-unified=<n>
.RS 4
Generate diffs with <n> lines of context instead of the usual three\. Implies "\-p"\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-raw
.RS 4
Generate the raw format\. This is the default\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-patch\-with\-raw
.RS 4
Synonym for "\-p \-\-raw"\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-stat[=width[,name\-width]]
.RS 4
Generate a diffstat\. You can override the default output width for 80\-column terminal by "\-\-stat=width"\. The width of the filename part can be controlled by giving another width to it separated by a comma\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-numstat
.RS 4
Similar to \-\-stat, but shows number of added and deleted lines in decimal notation and pathname without abbreviation, to make it more machine friendly\. For binary files, outputs two \- instead of saying 0 0\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-shortstat
.RS 4
Output only the last line of the \-\-stat format containing total number of modified files, as well as number of added and deleted lines\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-dirstat[=limit]
.RS 4
Output only the sub\-directories that are impacted by a diff, and to what degree they are impacted\. You can override the default cut\-off in percent (3) by "\-\-dirstat=limit"\. If you want to enable "cumulative" directory statistics, you can use the "\-\-cumulative" flag, which adds up percentages recursively even when they have been already reported for a sub\-directory\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-summary
.RS 4
Output a condensed summary of extended header information such as creations, renames and mode changes\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-patch\-with\-stat
.RS 4
Synonym for "\-p \-\-stat"\.
.RE
.PP
\-z
.RS 4
NUL\-line termination on output\. This affects the \-\-raw output field terminator\. Also output from commands such as "git\-log" will be delimited with NUL between commits\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-name\-only
.RS 4
Show only names of changed files\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-name\-status
.RS 4
Show only names and status of changed files\. See the description of the \-\-diff\-filter option on what the status letters mean\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-color
.RS 4
Show colored diff\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-no\-color
.RS 4
Turn off colored diff, even when the configuration file gives the default to color output\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-color\-words
.RS 4
Show colored word diff, i\.e\. color words which have changed\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-no\-renames
.RS 4
Turn off rename detection, even when the configuration file gives the default to do so\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-check
.RS 4
Warn if changes introduce trailing whitespace or an indent that uses a space before a tab\. Exits with non\-zero status if problems are found\. Not compatible with \-\-exit\-code\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-full\-index
.RS 4
Instead of the first handful characters, show full object name of pre\- and post\-image blob on the "index" line when generating a patch format output\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-binary
.RS 4
In addition to \-\-full\-index, output "binary diff" that can be applied with "git apply"\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-abbrev[=<n>]
.RS 4
Instead of showing the full 40\-byte hexadecimal object name in diff\-raw format output and diff\-tree header lines, show only handful hexdigits prefix\. This is independent of \-\-full\-index option above, which controls the diff\-patch output format\. Non default number of digits can be specified with \-\-abbrev=<n>\.
.RE
.PP
\-B
.RS 4
Break complete rewrite changes into pairs of delete and create\.
.RE
.PP
\-M
.RS 4
Detect renames\.
.RE
.PP
\-C
.RS 4
Detect copies as well as renames\. See also \-\-find\-copies\-harder\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-diff\-filter=[ACDMRTUXB*]
.RS 4
Select only files that are Added (A), Copied (C), Deleted (D), Modified (M), Renamed (R), have their type (mode) changed (T), are Unmerged (U), are Unknown (X), or have had their pairing Broken (B)\. Any combination of the filter characters may be used\. When * (All\-or\-none) is added to the combination, all paths are selected if there is any file that matches other criteria in the comparison; if there is no file that matches other criteria, nothing is selected\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-find\-copies\-harder
.RS 4
For performance reasons, by default, \-C option finds copies only if the original file of the copy was modified in the same changeset\. This flag makes the command inspect unmodified files as candidates for the source of copy\. This is a very expensive operation for large projects, so use it with caution\. Giving more than one \-C option has the same effect\.
.RE
.PP
\-l<num>
.RS 4
\-M and \-C options require O(n^2) processing time where n is the number of potential rename/copy targets\. This option prevents rename/copy detection from running if the number of rename/copy targets exceeds the specified number\.
.RE
.PP
\-S<string>
.RS 4
Look for differences that contain the change in <string>\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-pickaxe\-all
.RS 4
When \-S finds a change, show all the changes in that changeset, not just the files that contain the change in <string>\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-pickaxe\-regex
.RS 4
Make the <string> not a plain string but an extended POSIX regex to match\.
.RE
.PP
\-O<orderfile>
.RS 4
Output the patch in the order specified in the <orderfile>, which has one shell glob pattern per line\.
.RE
.PP
\-R
.RS 4
Swap two inputs; that is, show differences from index or on\-disk file to tree contents\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-relative[=<path>]
.RS 4
When run from a subdirectory of the project, it can be told to exclude changes outside the directory and show pathnames relative to it with this option\. When you are not in a subdirectory (e\.g\. in a bare repository), you can name which subdirectory to make the output relative to by giving a <path> as an argument\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-text
.RS 4
Treat all files as text\.
.RE
.PP
\-a
.RS 4
Shorthand for "\-\-text"\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-ignore\-space\-at\-eol
.RS 4
Ignore changes in whitespace at EOL\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-ignore\-space\-change
.RS 4
Ignore changes in amount of whitespace\. This ignores whitespace at line end, and considers all other sequences of one or more whitespace characters to be equivalent\.
.RE
.PP
\-b
.RS 4
Shorthand for "\-\-ignore\-space\-change"\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-ignore\-all\-space
.RS 4
Ignore whitespace when comparing lines\. This ignores differences even if one line has whitespace where the other line has none\.
.RE
.PP
\-w
.RS 4
Shorthand for "\-\-ignore\-all\-space"\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-exit\-code
.RS 4
Make the program exit with codes similar to diff(1)\. That is, it exits with 1 if there were differences and 0 means no differences\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-quiet
.RS 4
Disable all output of the program\. Implies \-\-exit\-code\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-ext\-diff
.RS 4
Allow an external diff helper to be executed\. If you set an external diff driver with \fBgitattributes\fR(5), you need to use this option with \fBgit-log\fR(1) and friends\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-no\-ext\-diff
.RS 4
Disallow external diff drivers\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-ignore\-submodules
.RS 4
Ignore changes to submodules in the diff generation\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-src\-prefix=<prefix>
.RS 4
Show the given source prefix instead of "a/"\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-dst\-prefix=<prefix>
.RS 4
Show the given destination prefix instead of "b/"\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-no\-prefix
.RS 4
Do not show any source or destination prefix\.
.RE
For more detailed explanation on these common options, see also \fBgitdiffcore\fR(7)\.
.PP
<tree\-ish>
.RS 4
The id of a tree object\.
.RE
.PP
<path>\&...
.RS 4
If provided, the results are limited to a subset of files matching one of these prefix strings\. i\.e\., file matches /^<pattern1>|<pattern2>|\&.../ Note that this parameter does not provide any wildcard or regexp features\.
.RE
.PP
\-r
.RS 4
recurse into sub\-trees
.RE
.PP
\-t
.RS 4
show tree entry itself as well as subtrees\. Implies \-r\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-root
.RS 4
When \fI\-\-root\fR is specified the initial commit will be showed as a big creation event\. This is equivalent to a diff against the NULL tree\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-stdin
.RS 4
When \fI\-\-stdin\fR is specified, the command does not take <tree\-ish> arguments from the command line\. Instead, it reads either one <commit> or a pair of <tree\-ish> separated with a single space from its standard input\.

When a single commit is given on one line of such input, it compares the commit with its parents\. The following flags further affects its behavior\. This does not apply to the case where two <tree\-ish> separated with a single space are given\.
.RE
.PP
\-m
.RS 4
By default, \fIgit\-diff\-tree \-\-stdin\fR does not show differences for merge commits\. With this flag, it shows differences to that commit from all of its parents\. See also \fI\-c\fR\.
.RE
.PP
\-s
.RS 4
By default, \fIgit\-diff\-tree \-\-stdin\fR shows differences, either in machine\-readable form (without \fI\-p\fR) or in patch form (with \fI\-p\fR)\. This output can be suppressed\. It is only useful with \fI\-v\fR flag\.
.RE
.PP
\-v
.RS 4
This flag causes \fIgit\-diff\-tree \-\-stdin\fR to also show the commit message before the differences\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-pretty[=\fI<format>\fR]
.RS 4
Pretty\-print the contents of the commit logs in a given format, where \fI<format>\fR can be one of \fIoneline\fR, \fIshort\fR, \fImedium\fR, \fIfull\fR, \fIfuller\fR, \fIemail\fR, \fIraw\fR and \fIformat:<string>\fR\. When omitted, the format defaults to \fImedium\fR\.

Note: you can specify the default pretty format in the repository configuration (see \fBgit-config\fR(1))\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-abbrev\-commit
.RS 4
Instead of showing the full 40\-byte hexadecimal commit object name, show only handful hexdigits prefix\. Non default number of digits can be specified with "\-\-abbrev=<n>" (which also modifies diff output, if it is displayed)\.

This should make "\-\-pretty=oneline" a whole lot more readable for people using 80\-column terminals\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-encoding[=<encoding>]
.RS 4
The commit objects record the encoding used for the log message in their encoding header; this option can be used to tell the command to re\-code the commit log message in the encoding preferred by the user\. For non plumbing commands this defaults to UTF\-8\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-no\-commit\-id
.RS 4
\fIgit\-diff\-tree\fR outputs a line with the commit ID when applicable\. This flag suppressed the commit ID output\.
.RE
.PP
\-c
.RS 4
This flag changes the way a merge commit is displayed (which means it is useful only when the command is given one <tree\-ish>, or \fI\-\-stdin\fR)\. It shows the differences from each of the parents to the merge result simultaneously instead of showing pairwise diff between a parent and the result one at a time (which is what the \fI\-m\fR option does)\. Furthermore, it lists only files which were modified from all parents\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-cc
.RS 4
This flag changes the way a merge commit patch is displayed, in a similar way to the \fI\-c\fR option\. It implies the \fI\-c\fR and \fI\-p\fR options and further compresses the patch output by omitting hunks that show differences from only one parent, or show the same change from all but one parent for an Octopus merge\. When this optimization makes all hunks disappear, the commit itself and the commit log message is not shown, just like in any other "empty diff" case\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-always
.RS 4
Show the commit itself and the commit log message even if the diff itself is empty\.
.RE
.SH "PRETTY FORMATS"
If the commit is a merge, and if the pretty\-format is not \fIoneline\fR, \fIemail\fR or \fIraw\fR, an additional line is inserted before the \fIAuthor:\fR line\. This line begins with "Merge: " and the sha1s of ancestral commits are printed, separated by spaces\. Note that the listed commits may not necessarily be the list of the \fBdirect\fR parent commits if you have limited your view of history: for example, if you are only interested in changes related to a certain directory or file\.

\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\fIraw\fR

The \fIraw\fR format shows the entire commit exactly as stored in the commit object\. Notably, the SHA1s are displayed in full, regardless of whether \-\-abbrev or \-\-no\-abbrev are used, and \fIparents\fR information show the true parent commits, without taking grafts nor history simplification into account\.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\fIformat:\fR

The \fIformat:\fR format allows you to specify which information you want to show\. It works a little bit like printf format, with the notable exception that you get a newline with \fI%n\fR instead of \fI\en\fR\.

E\.g, \fIformat:"The author of %h was %an, %ar%nThe title was >>%s<<%n"\fR would show something like this:

\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\fItformat:\fR

The \fItformat:\fR format works exactly like \fIformat:\fR, except that it provides "terminator" semantics instead of "separator" semantics\. In other words, each commit has the message terminator character (usually a newline) appended, rather than a separator placed between entries\. This means that the final entry of a single\-line format will be properly terminated with a new line, just as the "oneline" format does\. For example:

.sp
.RS 4
.nf

\.ft C
$ git log \-2 \-\-pretty=format:%h 4da45bef \e
  | perl \-pe \'$_ \.= " \-\- NO NEWLINE\en" unless /\en/\'

.SH "LIMITING OUTPUT"
If you\'re only interested in differences in a subset of files, for example some architecture\-specific files, you might do:

.sp
.RS 4
.nf
git diff\-tree \-r <tree\-ish> <tree\-ish> arch/ia64 include/asm\-ia64
.fi
.RE
and it will only show you what changed in those two directories\.

Or if you are searching for what changed in just kernel/sched\.c, just do

.sp
.RS 4
.nf
git diff\-tree \-r <tree\-ish> <tree\-ish> kernel/sched\.c
.fi
.RE
and it will ignore all differences to other files\.

The pattern is always the prefix, and is matched exactly\. There are no wildcards\. Even stricter, it has to match a complete path component\. I\.e\. "foo" does not pick up foobar\.h\. "foo" does match foo/bar\.h so it can be used to name subdirectories\.

An example of normal usage is:

.sp
.RS 4
.nf
torvalds@ppc970:~/git> git diff\-tree 5319e4\.\.\.\.\.\.

Once I do the reference tracking, I\'ll also make it print out all the

.RE
The similarity index is the percentage of unchanged lines, and the dissimilarity index is the percentage of changed lines\. It is a rounded down integer, followed by a percent sign\. The similarity index value of 100% is thus reserved for two equal files, while 100% dissimilarity means that no line from the old file made it into the new one\.

Similar to two\-line header for traditional \fIunified\fR diff format, /dev/null is used to signal created or deleted files\.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
\h'-04' 4.\h'+02'Chunk header format is modified to prevent people from accidentally feeding it to patch \-p1\. Combined diff format was created for review of merge commit changes, and was not meant for apply\. The change is similar to the change in the extended \fIindex\fR header:

.sp
.RS 4
.nf
@@@ <from\-file\-range> <from\-file\-range> <to\-file\-range> @@@
.fi
.RE
There are (number of parents + 1) @ characters in the chunk header for combined diff format\.
.RE
Unlike the traditional \fIunified\fR diff format, which shows two files A and B with a single column that has \- (minus \(em appears in A but removed in B), + (plus \(em missing in A but added to B), or " " (space \(em unchanged) prefix, this format compares two or more files file1, file2,\&... with one file X, and shows how X differs from each of fileN\. One column for each of fileN is prepended to the output line to note how X\'s line is different from it\.

A \- character in the column N means that the line appears in fileN but it does not appear in the result\. A + character in the column N means that the line appears in the last file, and fileN does not have that line (in other words, the line was added, from the point of view of that parent)\.

In the above example output, the function signature was changed from both files (hence two \- removals from both file1 and file2, plus + to mean one line that was added does not appear in either file1 nor file2)\. Also two other lines are the same from file1 but do not appear in file2 (hence prefixed with )\.

When shown by git diff\-tree \-c, it compares the parents of a merge commit with the merge result (i\.e\. file1\.\.fileN are the parents)\. When shown by git diff\-files \-c, it compares the two unresolved merge parents with the working tree file (i\.e\. file1 is stage 2 aka "our version", file2 is stage 3 aka "their version")\.
.SH "OTHER DIFF FORMATS"
The \-\-summary option describes newly added, deleted, renamed and copied files\. The \-\-stat option adds diffstat(1) graph to the output\. These options can be combined with other options, such as \-p, and are meant for human consumption\.

When showing a change that involves a rename or a copy, \-\-stat output formats the pathnames compactly by combining common prefix and suffix of the pathnames\. For example, a change that moves arch/i386/Makefile to arch/x86/Makefile while modifying 4 lines will be shown like this:

.sp
.RS 4
.nf

\.ft C
arch/{i386 => x86}/Makefile    |   4 +\-\-

The extra NUL before the preimage path in renamed case is to allow scripts that read the output to tell if the current record being read is a single\-path record or a rename/copy record without reading ahead\. After reading added and deleted lines, reading up to NUL would yield the pathname, but if that is NUL, the record will show two paths\.
