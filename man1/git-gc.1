.SH "NAME"
git\-gc \- Cleanup unnecessary files and optimize the local repository
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fIgit\-gc\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Runs a number of housekeeping tasks within the current repository, such as compressing file revisions (to reduce disk space and increase performance) and removing unreachable objects which may have been created from prior invocations of \fBgit\-add\fR(1).

Users are encouraged to run this task on a regular basis within each repository to maintain good disk space utilization and good operating performance.
.SH "CONFIGURATION"
The optional configuration variable \fIgc.reflogExpire\fR can be set to indicate how long historical entries within each branch's reflog should remain available in this repository. The setting is expressed as a length of time, for example \fI90 days\fR or \fI3 months\fR. It defaults to \fI90 days\fR.

The optional configuration variable \fIgc.reflogExpireUnreachable\fR can be set to indicate how long historical reflog entries which are not part of the current branch should remain available in this repository. These types of entries are generally created as a result of using git commit \-\-amend or git rebase and are the commits prior to the amend or rebase occuring. Since these changes are not part of the current project most users will want to expire them sooner. This option defaults to \fI30 days\fR.

The optional configuration variable \fIgc.rerereresolved\fR indicates how long records of conflicted merge you resolved earlier are kept. This defaults to 60 days.

The optional configuration variable \fIgc.rerereunresolved\fR indicates how long records of conflicted merge you have not resolved are kept. This defaults to 15 days.
