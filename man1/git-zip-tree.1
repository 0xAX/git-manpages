.SH NAME
git-zip-tree \- Creates a ZIP archive of the files in the named tree
.SH "SYNOPSIS"


\fIgit\-zip\-tree\fR [\-0|...|\-9] <tree\-ish> [ <base> ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"


Creates a ZIP archive containing the tree structure for the named tree\&. When <base> is specified it is added as a leading path to the files in the generated ZIP archive\&.


git\-zip\-tree behaves differently when given a tree ID versus when given a commit ID or tag ID\&. In the first case the current time is used as modification time of each file in the archive\&. In the latter case the commit time as recorded in the referenced commit object is used instead\&. Additionally the commit ID is stored as an archive comment\&.


Currently git\-zip\-tree can handle only files and directories, symbolic links are not supported\&.

.SH "OPTIONS"

\-0
