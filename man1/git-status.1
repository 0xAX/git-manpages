.SH "SYNOPSIS"


\fIgit\-status\fR

.SH "DESCRIPTION"


Examines paths in the working tree that has changes unrecorded to the index file, and changes between the index file and the current HEAD commit\&. The former paths are what you _could_ commit by running \fIgit\-update\-index\fR before running \fIgit commit\fR, and the latter paths are what you _would_ commit by running \fIgit commit\fR\&.


If there is no path that is different between the index file and the current HEAD commit, the command exits with non\-zero status\&.

.SH "OUTPUT"


The output from this command is designed to be used as a commit template comments, and all the output lines are prefixed with \fI#\fR\&.

.SH "DOCUMENTATION"
