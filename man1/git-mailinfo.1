.SH NAME
git-mailinfo \- Extracts patch from a single e-mail message.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"


git\-mailinfo [\-k] [\-u | \-\-encoding=<encoding>] <msg> <patch>

.SH "DESCRIPTION"


Reading a single e\-mail message from the standard input, and writes the commit log message in <msg> file, and the patches in <patch> file\&. The author name, e\-mail and e\-mail subject are written out to the standard output to be used by git\-applypatch to create a commit\&. It is usually not necessary to use this command directly\&.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
\-k
Usually the program cleans up the Subject: header line to extract the title line for the commit log message, among which (1) remove Re: or re:, (2) leading whitespaces, (3) [ up to ], typically [PATCH], and then prepends "[PATCH] "\&. This flag forbids this munging, and is most useful when used to read back git format\-patch \-\-mbox output\&.

.TP
\-u
By default, the commit log message, author name and author email are taken from the e\-mail without any charset conversion, after minimally decoding MIME transfer encoding\&. This flag causes the resulting commit to be encoded in the encoding specified by i18n\&.commitencoding configuration (defaults to utf\-8) by transliterating them\&. Note that the patch is always used as is without charset conversion, even with this flag\&.

.TP
\-\-encoding=<encoding>
Similar to \-u but if the local convention is different from what is specified by i18n\&.commitencoding, this flag can be used to override it\&.

.TP
<msg>
The commit log message extracted from e\-mail, usually except the title line which comes from e\-mail Subject\&.

.TP
<patch>
The patch extracted from e\-mail\&.
