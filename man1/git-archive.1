.SH "NAME"
git\-archive \- Create an archive of files from a named tree
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
.nf
\fIgit\-archive\fR \-\-format=<fmt> [\-\-list] [\-\-prefix=<prefix>/] [<extra>]
              [\-\-remote=<repo>] <tree\-ish> [path\&...]
.fi
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Creates an archive of the specified format containing the tree structure for the named tree. If <prefix> is specified it is prepended to the filenames in the archive.

\fIgit\-archive\fR behaves differently when given a tree ID versus when given a commit ID or tag ID. In the first case the current time is used as modification time of each file in the archive. In the latter case the commit time as recorded in the referenced commit object is used instead. Additionally the commit ID is stored in a global extended pax header if the tar format is used; it can be extracted using \fIgit\-get\-tar\-commit\-id\fR. In ZIP files it is stored as a file comment.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\-\-format=<fmt>
Format of the resulting archive: \fItar\fR, \fIzip\fR\&... The default is \fItar\fR.
.TP
\-\-list, \-l
Show all available formats.
.TP
\-\-verbose, \-v
Report progress to stderr.
.TP
\-\-prefix=<prefix>/
Prepend <prefix>/ to each filename in the archive.
.TP
<extra>
This can be any options that the archiver backend understand. See next section.
.TP
\-\-remote=<repo>
Instead of making a tar archive from local repository, retrieve a tar archive from a remote repository.
.TP
<tree\-ish>
The tree or commit to produce an archive for.
.TP
path
If one or more paths are specified, include only these in the archive, otherwise include all files and subdirectories.
.SH "BACKEND EXTRA OPTIONS"
.SS "zip"
.TP
\-0
Store the files instead of deflating them.
.TP
\-9
Highest and slowest compression level. You can specify any number from 1 to 9 to adjust compression speed and ratio.
.SH "CONFIGURATION"
.TP
tar.umask
This variable can be used to restrict the permission bits of tar archive entries. The default is 0002, which turns off the world write bit. The special value "user" indicates that the archiving user's umask will be used instead. See umask(2) for details.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.TP

Create a compressed tarball for v1.4.0 release, but without a global extended pax header.
.TP
git archive \-\-format=zip \-\-prefix=git\-docs/ HEAD:Documentation/ > git\-1.4.0\-docs.zip
