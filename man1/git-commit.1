.SH NAME
git-commit \- Record your changes
.SH "SYNOPSIS"

.nf
\fIgit\-commit\fR [\-a] [\-s] [\-v] [(\-c | \-C) <commit> | \-F <file> | \-m <msg>]
           [\-e] [\-\-author <author>] [\-\-] [[\-i | \-o ]<file>...]
.fi

.SH "DESCRIPTION"


Updates the index file for given paths, or all modified files if \fI\-a\fR is specified, and makes a commit object\&. The command VISUAL and EDITOR environment variables to edit the commit log message\&.


This command can run commit\-msg, pre\-commit, and post\-commit hooks\&. See hooks: \fIhooks.html\fR for more information\&.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
\-a|\-\-all
Update all paths in the index file\&. This flag notices files that have been modified and deleted, but new files you have not told git about are not affected\&.

.TP
\-c or \-C <commit>
Take existing commit object, and reuse the log message and the authorship information (including the timestamp) when creating the commit\&. With \fI\-C\fR, the editor is not invoked; with \fI\-c\fR the user can further edit the commit message\&.

.TP
\-F <file>
Take the commit message from the given file\&. Use \fI\-\fR to read the message from the standard input\&.

.TP
\-\-author <author>
Override the author name used in the commit\&. Use A U Thor <author@example\&.com> format\&.

.TP
\-m <msg>
Use the given <msg> as the commit message\&.

.TP
\-s|\-\-signoff
Add Signed\-off\-by line at the end of the commit message\&.

.TP
\-v|\-\-verify
Look for suspicious lines the commit introduces, and abort committing if there is one\&. The definition of \fIsuspicious lines\fR is currently the lines that has trailing whitespaces, and the lines whose indentation has a SP character immediately followed by a TAB character\&. This is the default\&.

.TP
\-n|\-\-no\-verify
The opposite of \-\-verify\&.

.TP
\-e|\-\-edit
The message taken from file with \-F, command line with \-m, and from file with \-C are usually used as the commit log message unmodified\&. This option lets you further edit the message taken from these sources\&.

.TP
\-i|\-\-include
Instead of committing only the files specified on the command line, update them in the index file and then commit the whole index\&. This is the traditional behaviour\&.

.TP
\-o|\-\-only
Commit only the files specified on the command line\&. This format cannot be used during a merge, nor when the index and the latest commit does not match on the specified paths to avoid confusion\&.

.TP
--
Do not interpret any more arguments as options\&.

.TP
<file>...
Files to be committed\&. The meaning of these is different between \-\-include and \-\-only\&. Without either, it defaults \-\-only semantics\&.


If you make a commit and then found a mistake immediately after that, you can recover from it with \fBgit\-reset\fR(1)\&.

.SH "DISCUSSION"


git commit without _any_ parameter commits the tree structure recorded by the current index file\&. This is a whole\-tree commit even the command is invoked from a subdirectory\&.


git commit \-\-include paths... is equivalent to

.nf
git update\-index \-\-remove paths\&.\&.\&.
git commit
.fi


That is, update the specified paths to the index and then commit the whole tree\&.


git commit paths... largely bypasses the index file and commits only the changes made to the specified paths\&. It has however several safety valves to prevent confusion\&.

.TP 3
1.
It refuses to run during a merge (i\&.e\&. when $GIT_DIR/MERGE_HEAD exists), and reminds trained git users that the traditional semantics now needs \-i flag\&.
.TP
2.
It refuses to run if named paths... are different in HEAD and the index (ditto about reminding)\&. Added paths are OK\&. This is because an earlier git diff (not git diff HEAD) would have shown the differences since the last git update\-index paths... to the user, and an inexperienced user may mistakenly think that the changes between the index and the HEAD (i\&.e\&. earlier changes made before the last git update\-index paths... was done) are not being committed\&.
.TP
3.
It reads HEAD commit into a temporary index file, updates the specified paths... and makes a commit\&. At the same time, the real index file is also updated with the same paths...\&.
.LP


git commit \-\-all updates the index file with _all_ changes to the working tree, and makes a whole\-tree commit, regardless of which subdirectory the command is invoked in\&.
