.SH NAME
git-commit \- Record your changes
.SH "SYNOPSIS"

.nf
git\-commit [\-a] [\-s] [\-v] [(\-c | \-C) <commit> | \-F <file> | \-m <msg>]
           [\-e] [\-\-] <file>...
.fi

.SH "DESCRIPTION"


Updates the index file for given paths, or all modified files if \-a is specified, and makes a commit object\&. The command VISUAL and EDITOR environment variables to edit the commit log message\&.


This command can run commit\-msg, pre\-commit, and post\-commit hooks\&. See hooks: \fIhooks.html\fR for more information\&.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
\-a|\-\-all
Update all paths in the index file\&. This flag notices files that have been modified and deleted, but new files you have not told git about are not affected\&.

.TP
\-c or \-C <commit>
Take existing commit object, and reuse the log message and the authorship information (including the timestamp) when creating the commit\&. With \-C, the editor is not invoked; with \-c the user can further edit the commit message\&.

.TP
\-F <file>
Take the commit message from the given file\&. Use \- to read the message from the standard input\&.

.TP
\-m <msg>
Use the given <msg> as the commit message\&.

.TP
\-s|\-\-signoff
Add Signed\-off\-by line at the end of the commit message\&.

.TP
\-v|\-\-verify
Look for suspicious lines the commit introduces, and abort committing if there is one\&. The definition of suspicious lines is currently the lines that has trailing whitespaces, and the lines whose indentation has a SP character immediately followed by a TAB character\&. This is the default\&.

.TP
\-n|\-\-no\-verify
The opposite of \-\-verify\&.

.TP
\-e|\-\-edit
The message taken from file with \-F, command line with \-m, and from file with \-C are usually used as the commit log message unmodified\&. This option lets you further edit the message taken from these sources\&.

.TP
--
Do not interpret any more arguments as options\&.

.TP
<file>...
Update specified paths in the index file before committing\&.


If you make a commit and then found a mistake immediately after that, you can recover from it with \fBgit\-reset\fR(1)\&.
