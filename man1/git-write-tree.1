.SH "NAME"
git\-write\-tree \- Creates a tree object from the current index
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fIgit\-write\-tree\fR [\-\-missing\-ok] [\-\-prefix=<prefix>/]
.sp
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Creates a tree object using the current index.
.sp
The index must be in a fully merged state.
.sp
Conceptually, git\-write\-tree sync()s the current index contents into a set of tree files. In order to have that match what is actually in your directory right now, you need to have done a git\-update\-index phase before you did the git\-write\-tree.
.sp
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\-\-missing\-ok
Normally
git\-write\-tree
ensures that the objects referenced by the directory exist in the object database. This option disables this check.
.TP
\-\-prefix=<prefix>/
Writes a tree object that represents a subdirectory
<prefix>. This can be used to write the tree object for a subproject that is in the named subdirectory.
