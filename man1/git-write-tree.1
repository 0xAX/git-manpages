.SH "NAME"
git-write-tree - Create a tree object from the current index
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fIgit write\-tree\fR [\-\-missing\-ok] [\-\-prefix=<prefix>/]
.sp
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Creates a tree object using the current index\.
.sp
The index must be in a fully merged state\.
.sp
Conceptually, \fIgit\-write\-tree\fR sync()s the current index contents into a set of tree files\. In order to have that match what is actually in your directory right now, you need to have done a \fIgit\-update\-index\fR phase before you did the \fIgit\-write\-tree\fR\.
.sp
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-\-missing\-ok
.RS 4
Normally
\fIgit\-write\-tree\fR
ensures that the objects referenced by the directory exist in the object database\. This option disables this check\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-prefix=<prefix>/
.RS 4
Writes a tree object that represents a subdirectory
<prefix>\. This can be used to write the tree object for a subproject that is in the named subdirectory\.
