.SH NAME
git-write-tree \- Creates a tree object from the current index
.SH "SYNOPSIS"


git\-write\-tree [\-\-missing\-ok]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"


Creates a tree object using the current index\&.


The index must be in a fully merged state\&.


Conceptually, git\-write\-tree sync()s the current index contents into a set of tree files\&. In order to have that match what is actually in your directory right now, you need to have done a git\-update\-index phase before you did the git\-write\-tree\&.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
\-\-missing\-ok
Normally git\-write\-tree ensures that the objects referenced by the directory exist in the object database\&. This option disables this check\&.

.SH "AUTHOR"


Written by Linus Torvalds <torvalds@osdl\&.org>

.SH "DOCUMENTATION"


Documentation by David Greaves, Junio C Hamano and the git\-list <git@vger\&.kernel\&.org>\&.

.SH "GIT"


Part of the \fBgit\fR(7) suite
