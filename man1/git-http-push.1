.SH NAME
git-http-push \- Push missing objects using HTTP/DAV
.SH "SYNOPSIS"


\fIgit\-http\-push\fR [\-\-complete] [\-\-force] [\-\-verbose] <url> <ref> [<ref>...]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"


Sends missing objects to remote repository, and updates the remote branch\&.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
\-\-complete
Do not assume that the remote repository is complete in its current state, and verify all objects in the entire local ref's history exist in the remote repository\&.

.TP
\-\-force
Usually, the command refuses to update a remote ref that is not an ancestor of the local ref used to overwrite it\&. This flag disables the check\&. What this means is that the remote repository can lose commits; use it with care\&.

.TP
\-\-verbose
Report the list of objects being walked locally and the list of objects successfully sent to the remote repository\&.


<ref>...: The remote refs to update\&.

.SH "SPECIFYING THE REFS"


A \fI<ref>\fR specification can be either a single pattern, or a pair of such patterns separated by a colon ":" (this means that a ref name cannot have a colon in it)\&. A single pattern \fI<name>\fR is just a shorthand for \fI<name>:<name>\fR\&.


Each pattern pair consists of the source side (before the colon) and the destination side (after the colon)\&. The ref to be pushed is determined by finding a match that matches the source side, and where it is pushed is determined by using the destination side\&.

.TP 3
\(bu
It is an error if <src> does not match exactly one of the local refs\&.
.TP
\(bu
If <dst> does not match any remote ref, either

.RS
.TP 3
\(bu
it has to start with "refs/"; <dst> is used as the destination literally in this case\&.
.TP
\(bu
<src> == <dst> and the ref that matched the <src> must not exist in the set of remote refs; the ref matched <src> locally is used as the name of the destination\&.
.LP
.RE
.IP
.LP


Without \fI\-\-force\fR, the <src> ref is stored at the remote only if <dst> does not exist, or <dst> is a proper subset (i\&.e\&. an ancestor) of <src>\&. This check, known as "fast forward check", is performed in order to avoid accidentally overwriting the remote ref and lose other peoples' commits from there\&.


With \fI\-\-force\fR, the fast forward check is disabled for all refs\&.


Optionally, a <ref> parameter can be prefixed with a plus \fI+\fR sign to disable the fast\-forward check only on that ref\&.
