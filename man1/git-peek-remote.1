.SH "NAME"
git\-peek\-remote \- Lists the references in a remote repository
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fIgit\-peek\-remote\fR [\-\-exec=<git\-upload\-pack>] [<host>:]<directory>
.sp
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Lists the references the remote repository has, and optionally stores them in the local repository under the same name.
.sp
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\-\-exec=<git\-upload\-pack>
Use this to specify the path to
\fIgit\-upload\-pack\fR
on the remote side, if it is not found on your $PATH. Some installations of sshd ignores the user's environment setup scripts for login shells (e.g. .bash_profile) and your privately installed git may not be found on the system default $PATH. Another workaround suggested is to set up your $PATH in ".bashrc", but this flag is for people who do not want to pay the overhead for non\-interactive shells, but prefer having a lean .bashrc file (they set most of the things up in .bash_profile).
.TP
<host>
A remote host that houses the repository. When this part is specified,
\fIgit\-upload\-pack\fR
is invoked via ssh.
.TP
<directory>
The repository to sync from.
