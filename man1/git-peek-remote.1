.SH "NAME"
git-peek-remote - List the references in a remote repository
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fIgit peek\-remote\fR [\-\-upload\-pack=<git\-upload\-pack>] [<host>:]<directory>
.sp
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This command is deprecated; use \fIgit\-ls\-remote\fR instead\.
.sp
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-\-upload\-pack=<git\-upload\-pack>
.RS 4
Use this to specify the path to
\fIgit\-upload\-pack\fR
on the remote side, if it is not found on your $PATH\. Some installations of sshd ignores the user\'s environment setup scripts for login shells (e\.g\. \.bash_profile) and your privately installed git may not be found on the system default $PATH\. Another workaround suggested is to set up your $PATH in "\.bashrc", but this flag is for people who do not want to pay the overhead for non\-interactive shells, but prefer having a lean \.bashrc file (they set most of the things up in \.bash_profile)\.
