.SH NAME
git-peek-remote \- Lists the references in a remote repository
.SH "SYNOPSIS"


\fIgit\-peek\-remote\fR [\-\-exec=<git\-upload\-pack>] [<host>:]<directory>

.SH "DESCRIPTION"


Lists the references the remote repository has, and optionally stores them in the local repository under the same name\&.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
\-\-exec=<git\-upload\-pack>
Use this to specify the path to \fIgit\-upload\-pack\fR on the remote side, if it is not found on your $PATH\&. Some installations of sshd ignores the user's environment setup scripts for login shells (e\&.g\&. \&.bash_profile) and your privately installed git may not be found on the system default $PATH\&. Another workaround suggested is to set up your $PATH in "\&.bashrc", but this flag is for people who do not want to pay the overhead for non\-interactive shells, but prefer having a lean \&.bashrc file (they set most of the things up in \&.bash_profile)\&.

.TP
<host>
A remote host that houses the repository\&. When this part is specified, \fIgit\-upload\-pack\fR is invoked via ssh\&.

.TP
<directory>
The repository to sync from\&.
