.SH "NAME"
git-bisect - Find by binary search the change that introduced a bug
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fIgit bisect\fR <subcommand> <options>
.sp
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The command takes various subcommands, and different options depending on the subcommand:
.sp
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
git bisect help
git bisect start [<bad> [<good>\.\.\.]] [\-\-] [<paths>\.\.\.]
git bisect bad [<rev>]
git bisect good [<rev>\.\.\.]
git bisect skip [(<rev>|<range>)\.\.\.]
git bisect reset [<branch>]
git bisect visualize
git bisect replay <logfile>
git bisect log
git bisect run <cmd>\.\.\.
.fi
.RE
This command uses \fIgit rev\-list \-\-bisect\fR to help drive the binary search process to find which change introduced a bug, given an old "good" commit object name and a later "bad" commit object name\.
.sp
.SS "Getting help"
Use "git bisect" to get a short usage description, and "git bisect help" or "git bisect \-h" to get a long usage description\.
.sp
.SS "Basic bisect commands: start, bad, good"
Using the Linux kernel tree as an example, basic use of the bisect command is as follows:
.sp
.sp
.RS 4
.nf

\.ft C
$ git bisect start
$ git bisect bad                 # Current version is bad
$ git bisect good v2\.6\.13\-rc2    # v2\.6\.13\-rc2 was the last version
                                 # tested that was good
\.ft

.fi
.RE
When you have specified at least one bad and one good version, the command bisects the revision tree and outputs something similar to the following:
.sp
.sp
.RS 4
.nf

\.ft C
Bisecting: 675 revisions left to test after this
\.ft

.fi
.RE
The state in the middle of the set of revisions is then checked out\. You would now compile that kernel and boot it\. If the booted kernel works correctly, you would then issue the following command:
.sp
.sp
.RS 4
.nf

\.ft C
$ git bisect good                       # this one is good
\.ft

.fi
.RE
The output of this command would be something similar to the following:
.sp
.sp
.RS 4
.nf

\.ft C
Bisecting: 337 revisions left to test after this
\.ft

.fi
.RE
You keep repeating this process, compiling the tree, testing it, and depending on whether it is good or bad issuing the command "git bisect good" or "git bisect bad" to ask for the next bisection\.
.sp
Eventually there will be no more revisions left to bisect, and you will have been left with the first bad kernel revision in "refs/bisect/bad"\.
.sp
.SS "Bisect reset"
To return to the original head after a bisect session, issue the following command:
.sp
.sp
.RS 4
.nf

\.ft C
$ git bisect reset
\.ft

.fi
.RE
This resets the tree to the original branch instead of being on the bisection commit ("git bisect start" will also do that, as it resets the bisection state)\.
.sp
.SS "Bisect visualize"
To see the currently remaining suspects in \fIgitk\fR, issue the following command during the bisection process:
.sp
.sp
.RS 4
.nf

\.ft C
$ git bisect visualize
\.ft

.fi
.RE
view may also be used as a synonym for visualize\.
.sp
If the \fIDISPLAY\fR environment variable is not set, \fIgit log\fR is used instead\. You can also give command line options such as \-p and \-\-stat\.
.sp
.sp
.RS 4
.nf

\.ft C
$ git bisect view \-\-stat
\.ft

.fi
.RE
.SS "Bisect log and bisect replay"
After having marked revisions as good or bad, issue the following command to show what has been done so far:
.sp
.sp
.RS 4
.nf

\.ft C
$ git bisect log
\.ft

.fi
.RE
If you discover that you made a mistake in specifying the status of a revision, you can save the output of this command to a file, edit it to remove the incorrect entries, and then issue the following commands to return to a corrected state:
.sp
.sp
.RS 4
.nf

\.ft C
$ git bisect reset
$ git bisect replay that\-file
\.ft

.fi
.RE
.SS "Avoiding testing a commit"
If, in the middle of a bisect session, you know that the next suggested revision is not a good one to test (e\.g\. the change the commit introduces is known not to work in your environment and you know it does not have anything to do with the bug you are chasing), you may want to find a nearby commit and try that instead\.
.sp
For example:
.sp
.sp
.RS 4
.nf

\.ft C
$ git bisect good/bad                   # previous round was good or bad\.
Bisecting: 337 revisions left to test after this
$ git bisect visualize                  # oops, that is uninteresting\.
$ git reset \-\-hard HEAD~3               # try 3 revisions before what
                                        # was suggested
\.ft

.fi
.RE
Then compile and test the chosen revision, and afterwards mark the revision as good or bad in the usual manner\.
.sp
.SS "Bisect skip"
Instead of choosing by yourself a nearby commit, you can ask git to do it for you by issuing the command:
.sp
.sp
.RS 4
.nf

\.ft C
$ git bisect skip                 # Current version cannot be tested
\.ft

.fi
.RE
But computing the commit to test may be slower afterwards and git may eventually not be able to tell the first bad commit among a bad commit and one or more skipped commits\.
.sp
You can even skip a range of commits, instead of just one commit, using the "\fI<commit1>\fR\.\.\fI<commit2>\fR" notation\. For example:
.sp
.sp
.RS 4
.nf

\.ft C
$ git bisect skip v2\.5\.\.v2\.6
\.ft

.fi
.RE
This tells the bisect process that no commit after v2\.5, up to and including v2\.6, should be tested\.
.sp
Note that if you also want to skip the first commit of the range you would issue the command:
.sp
.sp
.RS 4
.nf

\.ft C
$ git bisect skip v2\.5 v2\.5\.\.v2\.6
\.ft

.fi
.RE
This tells the bisect process that the commits between v2\.5 included and v2\.6 included should be skipped\.
.sp
.SS "Cutting down bisection by giving more parameters to bisect start"
You can further cut down the number of trials, if you know what part of the tree is involved in the problem you are tracking down, by specifying path parameters when issuing the bisect start command:
.sp
.sp
.RS 4
.nf

\.ft C
$ git bisect start \-\- arch/i386 include/asm\-i386
\.ft

.fi
.RE
If you know beforehand more than one good commit, you can narrow the bisect space down by specifying all of the good commits immediately after the bad commit when issuing the bisect start command:
.sp
.sp
.RS 4
.nf

\.ft C
$ git bisect start v2\.6\.20\-rc6 v2\.6\.20\-rc4 v2\.6\.20\-rc1 \-\-
                   # v2\.6\.20\-rc6 is bad
                   # v2\.6\.20\-rc4 and v2\.6\.20\-rc1 are good
\.ft

.fi
.RE
.SS "Bisect run"
If you have a script that can tell if the current source code is good or bad, you can bisect by issuing the command:
.sp
.sp
.RS 4
.nf

\.ft C
$ git bisect run my_script arguments
\.ft

.fi
.RE
Note that the script (my_script in the above example) should exit with code 0 if the current source code is good, and exit with a code between 1 and 127 (inclusive), except 125, if the current source code is bad\.
.sp
Any other exit code will abort the bisect process\. It should be noted that a program that terminates via "exit(\-1)" leaves $? = 255, (see the exit(3) manual page), as the value is chopped with "& 0377"\.
.sp
The special exit code 125 should be used when the current source code cannot be tested\. If the script exits with this code, the current revision will be skipped (see git bisect skip above)\.
.sp
You may often find that during a bisect session you want to have temporary modifications (e\.g\. s/#define DEBUG 0/#define DEBUG 1/ in a header file, or "revision that does not have this commit needs this patch applied to work around another problem this bisection is not interested in") applied to the revision being tested\.
.sp
To cope with such a situation, after the inner \fIgit bisect\fR finds the next revision to test, the script can apply the patch before compiling, run the real test, and afterwards decide if the revision (possibly with the needed patch) passed the test and then rewind the tree to the pristine state\. Finally the script should exit with the status of the real test to let the "git bisect run" command loop determine the eventual outcome of the bisect session\.

Here we use a "test\.sh" custom script\. In this script, if "make" fails, we skip the current commit\.
.sp
It is safer to use a custom script outside the repository to prevent interactions between the bisect, make and test processes and the script\.
.sp
"make test" should "exit 0", if the test suite passes, and "exit 1" otherwise\.
