.SH "DESCRIPTION"


You can query/set/replace/unset options with this command\&. The name is actually the section and the key separated by a dot, and the value will be escaped\&.


If you want to set/unset an option which can occur on multiple lines, a POSIX regexp value_regex needs to be given\&. Only the existing values that match the regexp are updated or unset\&. If you want to handle the lines that do \fInot\fR match the regex, just prepend a single exclamation mark in front (see EXAMPLES)\&.


The type specifier can be either \fI\-\-int\fR or \fI\-\-bool\fR, which will make \fIgit\-repo\-config\fR ensure that the variable(s) are of the given type and convert the value to the canonical form (simple decimal number for int, a "true" or "false" string for bool)\&. If no type specifier is passed, no checks or transformations are performed on the value\&.


This command will fail if:

1.
The \&.git/config file is invalid,

2.
Can not write to \&.git/config,
.TP

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
\-\-replace\-all
Default behavior is to replace at most one line\&. This replaces all lines matching the key (and optionally the value_regex)\&.

.TP
\-\-get
Get the value for a given key (optionally filtered by a regex matching the value)\&.

.TP
\-\-get\-all
Like get, but does not fail if the number of values for the key is not exactly one\&.

.TP
\-\-get\-regexp
Like \-\-get\-all, but interprets the name as a regular expression\&.

.TP
\-\-unset
Remove the line matching the key from \&.git/config\&.

.TP
\-\-unset\-all
Remove all matching lines from \&.git/config\&.

.TP
\-l, \-\-list
List all variables set in \&.git/config\&.

.SH "EXAMPLE"


Given a \&.git/config like this:

.nf
#
# This is the config file, and
# a '#' or ';' character indicates
# a comment
#
.fi

.nf
; core variables
[core]
        ; Don't trust file modes
        filemode = false
.fi

.nf
; Our diff algorithm
[diff]
        external = "/usr/local/bin/gnu\-diff \-u"
        renames = true
.fi

.nf
; Proxy settings
[core]
        gitproxy="ssh" for "ssh://kernel\&.org/"
        gitproxy="proxy\-command" for kernel\&.org
        gitproxy="myprotocol\-command" for "my://"
        gitproxy=default\-proxy ; for all the rest
.fi


you can set the filemode to true with

.nf
% git repo\-config core\&.filemode true
.fi


The hypothetic proxy command entries actually have a postfix to discern to what URL they apply\&. Here is how to change the entry for kernel\&.org to "ssh"\&.

.nf
% git repo\-config core\&.gitproxy '"ssh" for kernel\&.org' 'for kernel\&.org$'
.fi


This makes sure that only the key/value pair for kernel\&.org is replaced\&.


To delete the entry for renames, do

.nf
% git repo\-config \-\-unset diff\&.renames
.fi


If you want to delete an entry for a multivar (like core\&.gitproxy above), you have to provide a regex matching the value of exactly one line\&.


To query the value for a given key, do

.nf
% git repo\-config \-\-get core\&.filemode
.fi


or

.nf
% git repo\-config core\&.filemode
.fi


or, to query a multivar:

.nf
% git repo\-config \-\-get core\&.gitproxy "for kernel\&.org$"
.fi


If you want to know all the values for a multivar, do:

.nf
% git repo\-config \-\-get\-all core\&.gitproxy
.fi


If you like to live dangerous, you can replace \fIall\fR core\&.gitproxy by a new one with

.nf
% git repo\-config \-\-replace\-all core\&.gitproxy ssh
.fi


However, if you really only want to replace the line for the default proxy, i\&.e\&. the one without a "for ..." postfix, do something like this:

.nf
% git repo\-config core\&.gitproxy ssh '! for '
.fi


To actually match only values with an exclamation mark, you have to

.nf
% git repo\-config section\&.key value '[!]'
.fi

.SH "CONFIGURATION FILE"


The git configuration file contains a number of variables that affect the git commands behavior\&. They can be used by both the git plumbing and the porcelains\&. The variables are divided to sections, where in the fully qualified variable name the variable itself is the last dot\-separated segment and the section name is everything before the last dot\&. The variable names are case\-insensitive and only alphanumeric characters are allowed\&. Some variables may appear multiple times\&.


The syntax is fairly flexible and permissive; whitespaces are mostly ignored\&. The \fI#\fR and \fI;\fR characters begin commends to the end of line, blank lines are ignored, lines containing strings enclosed in square brackets start sections and all the other lines are recognized as setting variables, in the form \fIname = value\fR\&. If there is no equal sign on the line, the entire line is taken as \fIname\fR and the variable is recognized as boolean "true"\&. String values may be entirely or partially enclosed in double quotes; some variables may require special value format\&.

.SS "Example"

.nf
# Core variables
[core]
        ; Don't trust file modes
        filemode = false
.fi

.nf
# Our diff algorithm
[diff]
        external = "/usr/local/bin/gnu\-diff \-u"
        renames = true
.fi

.SS "Variables"


Note that this list is non\-comprehensive and not necessarily complete\&. For command\-specific variables, you will find more detailed description in the appropriate manual page\&. You will find description of non\-core porcelain configuration variables in the respective porcelain documentation\&.

.TP
core\&.fileMode
If false, the executable bit differences between the index and the working copy are ignored; useful on broken filesystems like FAT\&. See \fBgit\-update\-index\fR(1)\&. True by default\&.

.TP
core\&.gitProxy
A "proxy command" to execute (as \fIcommand host port\fR) instead of establishing direct connection to the remote server when using the git protocol for fetching\&. If the variable value is in the "COMMAND for DOMAIN" format, the command is applied only on hostnames ending with the specified domain string\&. This variable may be set multiple times and is matched in the given order; the first match wins\&.

.nf
Can be overridden by the 'GIT_PROXY_COMMAND' environment variable
(which always applies universally, without the special "for"
handling)\&.
.fi

.TP
core\&.ignoreStat
The working copy files are assumed to stay unchanged until you mark them otherwise manually \- Git will not detect the file changes by lstat() calls\&. This is useful on systems where those are very slow, such as Microsoft Windows\&. See \fBgit\-update\-index\fR(1)\&. False by default\&.

.TP
core\&.preferSymlinkRefs
Instead of the default "symref" format for HEAD and other symbolic reference files, use symbolic links\&. This is sometimes needed to work with old scripts that expect HEAD to be a symbolic link\&.

.TP
core\&.logAllRefUpdates
If true, git\-update\-ref will append a line to "$GIT_DIR/logs/<ref>" listing the new SHA1 and the date/time of the update\&. If the file does not exist it will be created automatically\&. This information can be used to determine what commit was the tip of a branch "2 days ago"\&. This value is false by default (no logging)\&.

.TP
core\&.repositoryFormatVersion
Internal variable identifying the repository format and layout version\&.

.TP
core\&.sharedRepository
If true, the repository is made shareable between several users in a group (making sure all the files and objects are group\-writable)\&. See \fBgit\-init\-db\fR(1)\&. False by default\&.

.TP
core\&.warnAmbiguousRefs
If true, git will warn you if the ref name you passed it is ambiguous and might match multiple refs in the \&.git/refs/ tree\&. True by default\&.

.TP
alias\&.*
Command aliases for the \fBgit\fR(1) command wrapper \- e\&.g\&. after defining "alias\&.last = cat\-file commit HEAD", the invocation "git last" is equivalent to "git cat\-file commit HEAD"\&. To avoid confusion, aliases that hide existing git commands are ignored\&. Arguments are split at whitespaces, but single or double quote pair can be used to quote them\&.

.TP
apply\&.whitespace
Tells git\-apply how to handle whitespaces, in the same way as the \fI\-\-whitespace\fR option\&. See \fBgit\-apply\fR(1)\&.

.TP
diff\&.renameLimit
The number of files to consider when performing the copy/rename detection; equivalent to the git diff option \fI\-l\fR\&.

.TP
format\&.headers
Additional email headers to include in a patch to be submitted by mail\&. See \fBgit\-format\-patch\fR(1)\&.

.TP
gitcvs\&.enabled
Whether the cvs pserver interface is enabled for this repository\&. See \fBgit\-cvsserver\fR(1)\&.

.TP
gitcvs\&.logfile
Path to a log file where the cvs pserver interface well... logs various stuff\&. See \fBgit\-cvsserver\fR(1)\&.

.TP
http\&.sslVerify
Whether to verify the SSL certificate when fetching or pushing over HTTPS\&. Can be overridden by the \fIGIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY\fR environment variable\&.

.TP
http\&.sslCert
File containing the SSL certificate when fetching or pushing over HTTPS\&. Can be overridden by the \fIGIT_SSL_CERT\fR environment variable\&.

.TP
http\&.sslKey
File containing the SSL private key when fetching or pushing over HTTPS\&. Can be overridden by the \fIGIT_SSL_KEY\fR environment variable\&.

.TP
http\&.sslCAInfo
File containing the certificates to verify the peer with when fetching or pushing over HTTPS\&. Can be overridden by the \fIGIT_SSL_CAINFO\fR environment variable\&.

.TP
http\&.sslCAPath
Path containing files with the CA certificates to verify the peer with when fetching or pushing over HTTPS\&. Can be overridden by the \fIGIT_SSL_CAPATH\fR environment variable\&.

.TP
http\&.maxRequests
How many HTTP requests to launch in parallel\&. Can be overridden by the \fIGIT_HTTP_MAX_REQUESTS\fR environment variable\&. Default is 5\&.

.TP
http\&.lowSpeedLimit, http\&.lowSpeedTime
If the HTTP transfer speed is less than \fIhttp\&.lowSpeedLimit\fR for longer than \fIhttp\&.lowSpeedTime\fR seconds, the transfer is aborted\&. Can be overridden by the \fIGIT_HTTP_LOW_SPEED_LIMIT\fR and \fIGIT_HTTP_LOW_SPEED_TIME\fR environment variables\&.

.TP
i18n\&.commitEncoding
Character encoding the commit messages are stored in; git itself does not care per se, but this information is necessary e\&.g\&. when importing commits from emails or in the gitk graphical history browser (and possibly at other places in the future or in other porcelains)\&. See e\&.g\&. \fBgit\-mailinfo\fR(1)\&. Defaults to \fIutf\-8\fR\&.

.TP
merge\&.summary
Whether to include summaries of merged commits in newly created merge commit messages\&. False by default\&.

.TP
pull\&.octopus
The default merge strategy to use when pulling multiple branches at once\&.

.TP

.TP
show\&.difftree
The default \fBgit\-diff\-tree\fR(1) arguments to be used for \fBgit\-show\fR(1)\&.

.TP
showbranch\&.default
The default set of branches for \fBgit\-show\-branch\fR(1)\&. See \fBgit\-show\-branch\fR(1)\&.

.TP
user\&.email
Your email address to be recorded in any newly created commits\&. Can be overridden by the \fIGIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL\fR and \fIGIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL\fR environment variables\&. See \fBgit\-commit\-tree\fR(1)\&.

.TP
user\&.name
Your full name to be recorded in any newly created commits\&. Can be overridden by the \fIGIT_AUTHOR_NAME\fR and \fIGIT_COMMITTER_NAME\fR environment variables\&. See \fBgit\-commit\-tree\fR(1)\&.

.TP
whatchanged\&.difftree
The default \fBgit\-diff\-tree\fR(1) arguments to be used for \fBgit\-whatchanged\fR(1)\&.

.TP
imap
The configuration variables in the \fIimap\fR section are described in \fBgit\-imap\-send\fR(1)\&.
