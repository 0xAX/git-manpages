.SH NAME
git-tar-tree \- Creates a tar archive of the files in the named tree
.SH "SYNOPSIS"


git\-tar\-tree <tree\-ish> [ <base> ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"


Creates a tar archive containing the tree structure for the named tree\&. When <base> is specified it is added as a leading path to the files in the generated tar archive\&.


git\-tar\-tree behaves differently when given a tree ID versus when given a commit ID or tag ID\&. In the first case the current time is used as modification time of each file in the archive\&. In the latter case the commit time as recorded in the referenced commit object is used instead\&. Additionally the commit ID is stored in a global extended pax header\&. It can be extracted using git\-get\-tar\-commit\-id\&.

.SH "AUTHOR"


Written by Rene Scharfe\&.

.SH "DOCUMENTATION"


Documentation by David Greaves, Junio C Hamano and the git\-list <git@vger\&.kernel\&.org>\&.

.SH "GIT"


Part of the \fBgit\fR(7) suite
