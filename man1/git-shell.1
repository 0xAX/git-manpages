.SH "NAME"
git\-shell \- Restricted login shell for GIT\-only SSH access
.SH "SYNOPSIS"

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is meant to be used as a login shell for SSH accounts you want to restrict to GIT pull/push access only. It permits execution only of server\-side GIT commands implementing the pull/push functionality. The commands can be executed only by the \fI\-c\fR option; the shell is not interactive.

Currently, only the git\-receive\-pack and git\-upload\-pack commands are permitted to be called, with a single required argument.
