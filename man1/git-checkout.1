.SH NAME
git-checkout \- Checkout and switch to a branch.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"


git\-checkout [\-f] [\-b <new_branch>] [\-m] [<branch>] [<paths>...]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"


When <paths> are not given, this command switches branches, by updating the index and working tree to reflect the specified branch, <branch>, and updating HEAD to be <branch> or, if specified, <new_branch>\&.


When <paths> are given, this command does not switch branches\&. It updates the named paths in the working tree from the index file (i\&.e\&. it runs git\-checkout\-index \-f \-u)\&. In this case, \-f and \-b options are meaningless and giving either of them results in an error\&. <branch> argument can be used to specify a specific tree\-ish to update the index for the given paths before updating the working tree\&.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
\-f
Force an re\-read of everything\&.

.TP
\-b
Create a new branch and start it at <branch>\&.

.TP
\-m
If you have local modifications to a file that is different between the current branch and the branch you are switching to, the command refuses to switch branches, to preserve your modifications in context\&. With this option, a three\-way merge between the current branch, your working tree contents, and the new branch is done, and you will be on the new branch\&.

When a merge conflict happens, the index entries for conflicting paths are left unmerged, and you need to resolve the conflicts and mark the resolved paths with git update\-index\&.

.TP
<new_branch>
Name for the new branch\&.

.TP
<branch>
Branch to checkout; may be any object ID that resolves to a commit\&. Defaults to HEAD\&.

.SH "EXAMPLES"

.TP 3
1.
The following sequence checks out the master branch, reverts the Makefile to two revisions back, deletes hello\&.c by mistake, and gets it back from the index\&.


.IP
$ git checkout master 
$ git checkout master~2 Makefile 
$ rm \-f hello\&.c
$ git checkout hello\&.c 

 switch branch
 take out a file out of other commit
 or "git checkout \-\- hello\&.c", as in the next example\&.If you have an unfortunate branch that is named hello\&.c, the last step above would be confused as an instruction to switch to that branch\&. You should instead write:

.IP
$ git checkout \-\- hello\&.c.TP
2.
After working in a wrong branch, switching to the correct branch you would want to is done with:


.IP
$ git checkout mytopicHowever, your "wrong" branch and correct "mytopic" branch may differ in files that you have locally modified, in which case, the above checkout would fail like this:


.IP
$ git checkout mytopic
fatal: Entry 'frotz' not uptodate\&. Cannot merge\&.You can give the \-m flag to the command, which would try a three\-way merge:


.IP
$ git checkout \-m mytopic
Auto\-merging frotzAfter this three\-way merge, the local modifications are _not_ registered in your index file, so git diff would show you what changes you made since the tip of the new branch\&.
.TP
3.
When a merge conflict happens during switching branches with the \-m option, you would see something like this:


.IP
$ git checkout \-m mytopic
Auto\-merging frotz
merge: warning: conflicts during merge
ERROR: Merge conflict in frotz
fatal: merge program failedAt this point, git diff shows the changes cleanly merged as in the previous example, as well as the changes in the conflicted files\&. Edit and resolve the conflict and mark it resolved with git update\-index as usual:

.IP
$ edit frotz
$ git update\-index frotz.LP
