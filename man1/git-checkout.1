.SH NAME
git-checkout \- Checkout and switch to a branch.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"


git\-checkout [\-f] [\-b <new_branch>] [<branch>] [<paths>...]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"


When <paths> are not given, this command switches branches, by updating the index and working tree to reflect the specified branch, <branch>, and updating HEAD to be <branch> or, if specified, <new_branch>\&.


When <paths> are given, this command does not switch branches\&. It updates the named paths in the working tree from the index file (i\&.e\&. it runs git\-checkout\-index \-f \-u)\&. In this case, \-f and \-b options are meaningless and giving either of them results in an error\&. <branch> argument can be used to specify a specific tree\-ish to update the index for the given paths before updating the working tree\&.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
\-f
Force an re\-read of everything\&.

.TP
\-b
Create a new branch and start it at <branch>\&.

.TP
<new_branch>
Name for the new branch\&.

.TP
<branch>
Branch to checkout; may be any object ID that resolves to a commit\&. Defaults to HEAD\&.

.SH "EXAMPLE"


The following sequence checks out the master branch, reverts the Makefile to two revisions back, deletes hello\&.c by mistake, and gets it back from the index\&.

.IP
$ git checkout master 
$ git checkout master~2 Makefile 
$ rm \-f hello\&.c
$ git checkout hello\&.c 

 switch branch
 take out a file out of other commit
 or "git checkout \-\- hello\&.c", as in the next example\&.

If you have an unfortunate branch that is named hello\&.c, the last step above would be confused as an instruction to switch to that branch\&. You should instead write:

.IP
$ git checkout \-\- hello\&.c
