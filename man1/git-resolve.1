.SH "NAME"
git\-resolve \- Merge two commits
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fIgit\-resolve\fR <current> <merged> <message>
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
DEPRECATED. Use git\-merge instead.

Given two commits and a merge message, merge the <merged> commit into <current> commit, with the commit log message <message>.

When <current> is a descendant of <merged>, or <current> is an ancestor of <merged>, no new commit is created and the <message> is ignored. The former is informally called "already up to date", and the latter is often called "fast forward".
.SH "AUTHOR"
Written by Linus Torvalds <torvalds@osdl.org> and Dan Holmsand <holmsand@gmail.com>.
.SH "DOCUMENTATION"
Documentation by David Greaves, Junio C Hamano and the git\-list <git@vger.kernel.org>.
.SH "GIT"
Part of the \fBgit\fR(7) suite
