.SH "NAME"
git\-pack\-refs \- Pack heads and tags for efficient repository access
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fIgit\-pack\-refs\fR [\-\-all] [\-\-prune]
.sp
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Traditionally, tips of branches and tags (collectively known as \fIrefs\fR) were stored one file per ref under $GIT_DIR/refs directory. While many branch tips tend to be updated often, most tags and some branch tips are never updated. When a repository has hundreds or thousands of tags, this one\-file\-per\-ref format both wastes storage and hurts performance.
.sp
This command is used to solve the storage and performance problem by stashing the refs in a single file, $GIT_DIR/packed\-refs. When a ref is missing from the traditional $GIT_DIR/refs hierarchy, it is looked up in this file and used if found.
.sp
Subsequent updates to branches always creates new file under $GIT_DIR/refs hierarchy.
.sp
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\-\-all
The command by default packs all tags and leaves branch tips alone. This is because branches are expected to be actively developed and packing their tips does not help performance. This option causes branch tips to be packed as well. Useful for a repository with many branches of historical interests.
.TP
\-\-prune
After packing the refs, remove loose refs under
$GIT_DIR/refs
hierarchy. This should probably become default.
