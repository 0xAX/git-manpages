.SH "NAME"
git\-cherry \- Find commits not merged upstream
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fIgit\-cherry\fR [\-v] <upstream> [<head>]
.sp
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The changeset (or "diff") of each commit between the fork\-point and <head> is compared against each commit between the fork\-point and <upstream>.
.sp
Every commit that doesn't exist in the <upstream> branch has its id (sha1) reported, prefixed by a symbol. The ones that have equivalent change already in the <upstream> branch are prefixed with a minus (\-) sign, and those that only exist in the <head> branch are prefixed with a plus (+) symbol.
.sp
Because git\-cherry compares the changeset rather than the commit id (sha1), you can use git\-cherry to find out if a commit you made locally has been applied <upstream> under a different commit id. For example, this will happen if you're feeding patches <upstream> via email rather than pushing or pulling commits directly.
