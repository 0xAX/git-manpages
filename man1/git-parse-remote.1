.SH "NAME"
git\-parse\-remote \- Routines to help parsing remote repository access parameters
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fI. git\-parse\-remote\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This script is included in various scripts to supply routines to parse files under $GIT_DIR/remotes/ and $GIT_DIR/branches/ and configuration variables that are related to fetching, pulling and pushing.

The primary entry points are:
.TP
get_remote_refs_for_fetch
Given the list of user\-supplied <repo> <refspec>\&..., return the list of refs to fetch after canonicalizing them into $GIT_DIR relative paths (e.g. refs/heads/foo). When <refspec>\&... is empty the returned list of refs consists of the defaults for the given <repo>, if specified in $GIT_DIR/remotes/, $GIT_DIR/branches/, or remote.*.fetch configuration.
.TP
get_remote_refs_for_push
Given the list of user\-supplied <repo> <refspec>\&..., return the list of refs to push in a form suitable to be fed to the git\-send\-pack command. When <refspec>\&... is empty the returned list of refs consists of the defaults for the given <repo>, if specified in $GIT_DIR/remotes/.
