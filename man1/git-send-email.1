.SH "NAME"
git\-send\-email \- Send a collection of patches as emails
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fIgit\-send\-email\fR [options] <file|directory> [\&... file|directory]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Takes the patches given on the command line and emails them out.

The header of the email is configurable by command line options. If not specified on the command line, the user will be prompted with a ReadLine enabled interface to provide the necessary information.
.SH "OPTIONS"
The options available are:
.TP
\-\-bcc
Specify a "Bcc:" value for each email.

The \-\-bcc option must be repeated for each user you want on the bcc list.
.TP
\-\-cc
Specify a starting "Cc:" value for each email.

The \-\-cc option must be repeated for each user you want on the cc list.
.TP
\-\-chain\-reply\-to, \-\-no\-chain\-reply\-to
If this is set, each email will be sent as a reply to the previous email sent. If disabled with "\-\-no\-chain\-reply\-to", all emails after the first will be sent as replies to the first email sent. When using this, it is recommended that the first file given be an overview of the entire patch series. Default is \-\-chain\-reply\-to
.TP
\-\-compose
Use $EDITOR to edit an introductory message for the patch series.
.TP
\-\-from
Specify the sender of the emails. This will default to the value GIT_COMMITTER_IDENT, as returned by "git\-var \-l". The user will still be prompted to confirm this entry.
.TP
\-\-in\-reply\-to
Specify the contents of the first In\-Reply\-To header. Subsequent emails will refer to the previous email instead of this if \-\-chain\-reply\-to is set (the default) Only necessary if \-\-compose is also set. If \-\-compose is not set, this will be prompted for.
.TP
\-\-no\-signed\-off\-by\-cc
Do not add emails found in Signed\-off\-by: lines to the cc list.
.TP
\-\-quiet
Make git\-send\-email less verbose. One line per email should be all that is output.
.TP
\-\-smtp\-server
If set, specifies the outgoing SMTP server to use. A full pathname of a sendmail\-like program can be specified instead; the program must support the \-i option. Default value can be specified by the \fIsendemail.smtpserver\fR configuration option; the built\-in default is /usr/sbin/sendmail or /usr/lib/sendmail if such program is available, or localhost otherwise.
.TP
\-\-subject
Specify the initial subject of the email thread. Only necessary if \-\-compose is also set. If \-\-compose is not set, this will be prompted for.
.TP
\-\-suppress\-from
Do not add the From: address to the cc: list, if it shows up in a From: line.
.TP
\-\-to
Specify the primary recipient of the emails generated. Generally, this will be the upstream maintainer of the project involved.

The \-\-to option must be repeated for each user you want on the to list.
