The header of the email is configurable by command line options\. If not specified on the command line, the user will be prompted with a ReadLine enabled interface to provide the necessary information\.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.SS "Composing"
.PP
\-\-bcc
.RS 4
Specify a "Bcc:" value for each email\. Default is the value of \fIsendemail\.bcc\fR\.

.RE
.PP
\-\-compose
.RS 4
Use $GIT_EDITOR, core\.editor, $VISUAL, or $EDITOR to edit an introductory message for the patch series\.

When \fI\-\-compose\fR is used, git send\-email gets less interactive will use the values of the headers you set there\. If the body of the email (what you type after the headers and a blank line) only contains blank (or GIT: prefixed) lines, the summary won\'t be sent, but git\-send\-email will still use the Headers values if you don\'t removed them\.

If it wasn\'t able to see a header in the summary it will ask you about it interactively after quitting your editor\.
.RE
