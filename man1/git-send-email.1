.SH "NAME"
git-send-email - Send a collection of patches as emails
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fIgit send\-email\fR [options] <file|directory|rev\-list options>\&...
.sp
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Takes the patches given on the command line and emails them out\.
.sp
The header of the email is configurable by command line options\. If not specified on the command line, the user will be prompted with a ReadLine enabled interface to provide the necessary information\.
.sp
There are two formats accepted for patch files:
.sp
.sp
.RS 4
\h'-04' 1.\h'+02'mbox format files
.sp
This is what
\fBgit-format-patch\fR(1)
generates\. Most headers and MIME formatting are ignored\.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
\h'-04' 2.\h'+02'The original format used by Greg Kroah\-Hartman\'s
\fIsend_lots_of_email\.pl\fR
script
.sp
This format expects the first line of the file to contain the "Cc:" value and the "Subject:" of the message as the second line\.
.RE
.SH "OPTIONS"
.SS "Composing"
.PP
\-\-bcc=<address>
.RS 4
Specify a "Bcc:" value for each email\. Default is the value of
\fIsendemail\.bcc\fR\.
.sp
The \-\-bcc option must be repeated for each user you want on the bcc list\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-cc=<address>
.RS 4
Specify a starting "Cc:" value for each email\. Default is the value of
\fIsendemail\.cc\fR\.
.sp
The \-\-cc option must be repeated for each user you want on the cc list\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-annotate
.RS 4
Review each patch you\'re about to send in an editor\. The setting
\fIsendemail\.multiedit\fR
defines if this will spawn one editor per patch or one for all of them at once\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-compose
.RS 4
Use $GIT_EDITOR, core\.editor, $VISUAL, or $EDITOR to edit an introductory message for the patch series\.
.sp
When
\fI\-\-compose\fR
is used, git send\-email will use the From, Subject, and In\-Reply\-To headers specified in the message\. If the body of the message (what you type after the headers and a blank line) only contains blank (or GIT: prefixed) lines the summary won\'t be sent, but From, Subject, and In\-Reply\-To headers will be used unless they are removed\.
.sp
Missing From or In\-Reply\-To headers will be prompted for\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-from=<address>
.RS 4
Specify the sender of the emails\. This will default to the value GIT_COMMITTER_IDENT, as returned by "git var \-l"\. The user will still be prompted to confirm this entry\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-in\-reply\-to=<identifier>
.RS 4
Specify the contents of the first In\-Reply\-To header\. Subsequent emails will refer to the previous email instead of this if \-\-chain\-reply\-to is set (the default) Only necessary if \-\-compose is also set\. If \-\-compose is not set, this will be prompted for\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-subject=<string>
.RS 4
Specify the initial subject of the email thread\. Only necessary if \-\-compose is also set\. If \-\-compose is not set, this will be prompted for\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-to=<address>
.RS 4
Specify the primary recipient of the emails generated\. Generally, this will be the upstream maintainer of the project involved\. Default is the value of the
\fIsendemail\.to\fR
configuration value; if that is unspecified, this will be prompted for\.
.sp
The \-\-to option must be repeated for each user you want on the to list\.
.RE
.SS "Sending"
.PP
\-\-envelope\-sender=<address>
.RS 4
Specify the envelope sender used to send the emails\. This is useful if your default address is not the address that is subscribed to a list\. If you use the sendmail binary, you must have suitable privileges for the \-f parameter\. Default is the value of the
\fIsendemail\.envelopesender\fR
configuration variable; if that is unspecified, choosing the envelope sender is left to your MTA\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-smtp\-encryption=<encryption>
.RS 4
Specify the encryption to use, either
\fIssl\fR
or
\fItls\fR\. Any other value reverts to plain SMTP\. Default is the value of
\fIsendemail\.smtpencryption\fR\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-smtp\-pass[=<password>]
.RS 4
Password for SMTP\-AUTH\. The argument is optional: If no argument is specified, then the empty string is used as the password\. Default is the value of
\fIsendemail\.smtppass\fR, however
\fI\-\-smtp\-pass\fR
always overrides this value\.
.sp
Furthermore, passwords need not be specified in configuration files or on the command line\. If a username has been specified (with
\fI\-\-smtp\-user\fR
or a
\fIsendemail\.smtpuser\fR), but no password has been specified (with
\fI\-\-smtp\-pass\fR
or
\fIsendemail\.smtppass\fR), then the user is prompted for a password while the input is masked for privacy\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-smtp\-server=<host>
.RS 4
If set, specifies the outgoing SMTP server to use (e\.g\.
smtp\.example\.com
or a raw IP address)\. Alternatively it can specify a full pathname of a sendmail\-like program instead; the program must support the
\-i
option\. Default value can be specified by the
\fIsendemail\.smtpserver\fR
configuration option; the built\-in default is
/usr/sbin/sendmail
or
/usr/lib/sendmail
if such program is available, or
localhost
otherwise\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-smtp\-server\-port=<port>
.RS 4
Specifies a port different from the default port (SMTP servers typically listen to smtp port 25 and ssmtp port 465)\. This can be set with

.PP
\-\-[no\-]chain\-reply\-to=<identifier>
.RS 4
If this is set, each email will be sent as a reply to the previous email sent\. If disabled with "\-\-no\-chain\-reply\-to", all emails after the first will be sent as replies to the first email sent\. When using this, it is recommended that the first file given be an overview of the entire patch series\. Default is the value of the
\fIsendemail\.chainreplyto\fR
configuration value; if that is unspecified, default to \-\-chain\-reply\-to\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-identity=<identity>
.RS 4
