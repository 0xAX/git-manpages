.SH NAME
git-mv \- Script used to move or rename a file, directory or symlink.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"


git\-mv <options>... <args>...

.SH "DESCRIPTION"


This script is used to move or rename a file, directory or symlink\&.

.nf
git\-mv [\-f] [\-n] <source> <destination>
git\-mv [\-f] [\-n] [\-k] <source> \&.\&.\&. <destination directory>
.fi


In the first form, it renames <source>, which must exist and be either a file, symlink or directory, to <destination>\&. In the second form, the last argument has to be an existing directory; the given sources will be moved into this directory\&.


The index is updated after successful completion, but the change must still be committed\&.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
\-f
Force renaming or moving of a file even if the target exists

.TP
\-k
Skip move or rename actions which would lead to an error condition\&. An error happens when a source is neither existing nor controlled by GIT, or when it would overwrite an existing file unless \-f is given\&.

.TP
\-n
Do nothing; only show what would happen
