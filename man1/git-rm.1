.SH "NAME"
git\-rm \- Remove files from the working tree and from the index
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fIgit\-rm\fR [\-f] [\-n] [\-r] [\-\-cached] [\-\-] <file>\&...
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Remove files from the working tree and from the index. The files have to be identical to the tip of the branch, and no updates to its contents must have been placed in the staging area (aka index).
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
<file>\&...
Files to remove. Fileglobs (e.g. *.c) can be given to remove all matching files. Also a leading directory name (e.g. dir to add dir/file1 and dir/file2) can be given to remove all files in the directory, recursively, but this requires \-r option to be given for safety.
.TP
\-f
Override the up\-to\-date check.
.TP
\-n
Don't actually remove the file(s), just show if they exist in the index.
.TP
\-r
Allow recursive removal when a leading directory name is given.
.TP
\-\-
This option can be used to separate command\-line options from the list of files, (useful when filenames might be mistaken for command\-line options).
.TP
\-\-cached
This option can be used to tell the command to remove the paths only from the index, leaving working tree files.
.SH "DISCUSSION"
The list of <file> given to the command can be exact pathnames, file glob patterns, or leading directory name. The command removes only the paths that is known to git. Giving the name of a file that you have not told git about does not remove that file.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.TP
git\-rm Documentation/\\*.txt
Removes all *.txt files from the index that are under the Documentation directory and any of its subdirectories.

Note that the asterisk * is quoted from the shell in this example; this lets the command include the files from subdirectories of Documentation/ directory.
.TP
git\-rm \-f git\-*.sh
Remove all git\-*.sh scripts that are in the index. Because this example lets the shell expand the asterisk (i.e. you are listing the files explicitly), it does not remove subdir/git\-foo.sh.
