.SH "NAME"
git\-rm \- Remove files from the working tree and from the index
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fIgit\-rm\fR [\-f] [\-n] [\-v] [\-\-] <file>\&...
.sp
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
A convenience wrapper for git\-update\-index \-\-remove. For those coming from cvs, git\-rm provides an operation similar to "cvs rm" or "cvs remove".
.sp
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
<file>\&...
Files to remove from the index and optionally, from the working tree as well.
.TP
\-f
Remove files from the working tree as well as from the index.
.TP
\-n
Don't actually remove the file(s), just show if they exist in the index.
.TP
\-v
Be verbose.
.TP
\-\-
This option can be used to separate command\-line options from the list of files, (useful when filenames might be mistaken for command\-line options).
.SH "DISCUSSION"
The list of <file> given to the command is fed to git\-ls\-files command to list files that are registered in the index and are not ignored/excluded by $GIT_DIR/info/exclude file or .gitignore file in each directory. This means two things:
.sp
.TP 3
1.
You can put the name of a directory on the command line, and the command will remove all files in it and its subdirectories (the directories themselves are never removed from the working tree);
.TP
2.
Giving the name of a file that is not in the index does not remove that file.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.TP
git\-rm Documentation/\\*.txt
Removes all
*.txt
files from the index that are under the
Documentation
directory and any of its subdirectories. The files are not removed from the working tree.
.sp
Note that the asterisk
*
is quoted from the shell in this example; this lets the command include the files from subdirectories of
Documentation/
directory.
.TP
git\-rm \-f git\-*.sh
Remove all git\-*.sh scripts that are in the index. The files are removed from the index, and (because of the \-f option), from the working tree as well. Because this example lets the shell expand the asterisk (i.e. you are listing the files explicitly), it does not remove
subdir/git\-foo.sh.
