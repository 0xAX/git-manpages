\fIgit clean\fR [\-d] [\-f] [\-n] [\-q] [\-x | \-X] [\-\-] <path>\&...

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Cleans the working tree by recursively removing files that are not under version control, starting from the current directory\.
.sp
Normally, only files unknown to git are removed, but if the \fI\-x\fR option is specified, ignored files are also removed\. This can, for example, be useful to remove all build products\.
.sp
If any optional <path>\&... arguments are given, only those paths are affected\.
.sp
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-d
.RS 4
Remove untracked directories in addition to untracked files\.
.RE
.PP
\-f
.RS 4
If the git configuration specifies clean\.requireForce as true,
\fIgit\-clean\fR
will refuse to run unless given \-f or \-n\.
.RE
.PP
\-n, \-\-dry\-run
.RS 4
Don\'t actually remove anything, just show what would be done\.
.RE
.PP
\-q, \-\-quiet
.RS 4
Be quiet, only report errors, but not the files that are successfully removed\.
.RE
.PP
\-x
.RS 4
Don\'t use the ignore rules\. This allows removing all untracked files, including build products\. This can be used (possibly in conjunction with
\fIgit\-reset\fR) to create a pristine working directory to test a clean build\.
.RE
.PP
\-X
.RS 4
Remove only files ignored by git\. This may be useful to rebuild everything from scratch, but keep manually created files\.
