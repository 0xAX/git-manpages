.SH NAME
git-mktag \- Creates a tag object
.SH "SYNOPSIS"


git\-mktag < signature_file

.SH "DESCRIPTION"


Reads a tag contents on standard input and creates a tag object that can also be used to sign other objects\&.


The output is the new tag's <object> identifier\&.

.SH "TAG FORMAT"


A tag signature file has a very simple fixed format: three lines of

.nf
object <sha1>
type <typename>
tag <tagname>
.fi


followed by some optional free\-form signature that git itself doesn't care about, but that can be verified with gpg or similar\&.


The size of the full object is artificially limited to 8kB\&. (Just because I'm a lazy bastard, and if you can't fit a signature in that size, you're doing something wrong)

.SH "AUTHOR"

.SH "DOCUMENTATION"


Documentation by David Greaves, Junio C Hamano and the git\-list <git@vger\&.kernel\&.org>\&.
