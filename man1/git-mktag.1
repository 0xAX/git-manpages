.SH "NAME"
git\-mktag \- Creates a tag object
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fIgit\-mktag\fR < signature_file
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Reads a tag contents on standard input and creates a tag object that can also be used to sign other objects.

The output is the new tag's <object> identifier.
.SH "TAG FORMAT"
A tag signature file has a very simple fixed format: four lines of
.sp
.nf
object <sha1>
type <typename>
tag <tagname>
tagger <tagger>
.fi
followed by some \fIoptional\fR free\-form message (some tags created by older git may not have tagger line). The message, when exists, is separated by a blank line from the header. The message part may contain a signature that git itself doesn't care about, but that can be verified with gpg.
