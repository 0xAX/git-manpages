.SH NAME
git-cherry-pick \- Apply the change introduced by an existing commit
.SH "SYNOPSIS"


\fIgit\-cherry\-pick\fR [\-\-edit] [\-n] [\-r] <commit>

.SH "DESCRIPTION"


Given one existing commit, apply the change the patch introduces, and record a new commit that records it\&. This requires your working tree to be clean (no modifications from the HEAD commit)\&.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
<commit>
Commit to cherry\-pick\&.

.TP
\-e|\-\-edit
With this option, git\-cherry\-pick will let you edit the commit message prior committing\&.

.TP
\-r|\-\-replay
Usually the command appends which commit was cherry\-picked after the original commit message when making a commit\&. This option, \fI\-\-replay\fR, causes it to use the original commit message intact\&. This is useful when you are reordering the patches in your private tree before publishing\&.

.TP
\-n|\-\-no\-commit
Usually the command automatically creates a commit with a commit log message stating which commit was cherry\-picked\&. This flag applies the change necessary to cherry\-pick the named commit to your working tree, but does not make the commit\&. In addition, when this option is used, your working tree does not have to match the HEAD commit\&. The cherry\-pick is done against the beginning state of your working tree\&.

This is useful when cherry\-picking more than one commits' effect to your working tree in a row\&.
