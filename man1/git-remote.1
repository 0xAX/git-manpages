.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Manage the set of repositories ("remotes") whose branches you track\.
.sp
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-v, \-\-verbose
.RS 4
Be a little more verbose and show remote url after name\.
.RE
.SH "COMMANDS"
With no arguments, shows a list of existing remotes\. Several subcommands are available to perform operations on the remotes\.
.PP
\fIadd\fR
.RS 4
Adds a remote named <name> for the repository at <url>\. The command
git fetch <name>
can then be used to create and update remote\-tracking branches <name>/<branch>\.
.sp
With
\-f
option,
git fetch <name>
is run immediately after the remote information is set up\.
.sp
With
\-t <branch>
option, instead of the default glob refspec for the remote to track all branches under
$GIT_DIR/remotes/<name>/, a refspec to track only
<branch>
is created\. You can give more than one
\-t <branch>
to track multiple branches without grabbing all branches\.
.sp
With
\-m <master>
option,
$GIT_DIR/remotes/<name>/HEAD
is set up to point at remote\'s
<master>
branch\. See also the set\-head command\.
.sp
In mirror mode, enabled with
\-\-mirror, the refs will not be stored in the
\fIrefs/remotes/\fR
namespace, but in
\fIrefs/heads/\fR\. This option only makes sense in bare repositories\. If a remote uses mirror mode, furthermore,
git push
will always behave as if
\-\-mirror
was passed\.
.RE
.PP
\fIrename\fR
.RS 4
Rename the remote named <old> to <new>\. All remote tracking branches and configuration settings for the remote are updated\.
.sp
In case <old> and <new> are the same, and <old> is a file under
$GIT_DIR/remotes
or
$GIT_DIR/branches, the remote is converted to the configuration file format\.
.RE
.PP
\fIrm\fR
.RS 4
Remove the remote named <name>\. All remote tracking branches and configuration settings for the remote are removed\.
.RE
.PP
\fIset\-head\fR
.RS 4
Sets or deletes the default branch ($GIT_DIR/remotes/<name>/HEAD) for the named remote\. Having a default branch for a remote is not required, but allows the name of the remote to be specified in lieu of a specific branch\. For example, if the default branch for
origin
is set to
master, then
origin
may be specified wherever you would normally specify
origin/master\.
.sp
With
\-d,
$GIT_DIR/remotes/<name>/HEAD
is deleted\.
.sp
With
\-a, the remote is queried to determine its
HEAD, then
$GIT_DIR/remotes/<name>/HEAD
is set to the same branch\. e\.g\., if the remote
HEAD
is pointed at
next, "git remote set\-head origin \-a" will set
$GIT_DIR/refs/remotes/origin/HEAD
to
refs/remotes/origin/next\. This will only work if
refs/remotes/origin/next
already exists; if not it must be fetched first\.
.sp
Use
<branch>
to set
$GIT_DIR/remotes/<name>/HEAD
explicitly\. e\.g\., "git remote set\-head origin master" will set
$GIT_DIR/refs/remotes/origin/HEAD
to
refs/remotes/origin/master\. This will only work if
refs/remotes/origin/master
already exists; if not it must be fetched first\.
.RE
.PP
\fIshow\fR
.RS 4
Gives some information about the remote <name>\.
.sp
With
\-n
option, the remote heads are not queried first with
git ls\-remote <name>; cached information is used instead\.
.RE
.PP
\fIprune\fR
.RS 4
Deletes all stale tracking branches under <name>\. These stale branches have already been removed from the remote repository referenced by <name>, but are still locally available in "remotes/<name>"\.
.sp
With
\-\-dry\-run
option, report what branches will be pruned, but do no actually prune them\.
.RE
.PP
\fIupdate\fR
.RS 4
Fetch updates for a named set of remotes in the repository as defined by remotes\.<group>\. If a named group is not specified on the command line, the configuration parameter remotes\.default will get used; if remotes\.default is not defined, all remotes which do not have the configuration parameter remote\.<name>\.skipDefaultUpdate set to true will be updated\. (See
\fBgit-config\fR(1))\.
.RE
.SH "DISCUSSION"
The remote configuration is achieved using the remote\.origin\.url and remote\.origin\.fetch configuration variables\. (See \fBgit-config\fR(1))\.
