.SH "NAME"
git-log - Show commit logs
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fIgit log\fR <option>\&...
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Shows the commit logs\.

The command takes options applicable to the \fIgit\-rev\-list\fR command to control what is shown and how, and options applicable to the \fIgit\-diff\-*\fR commands to control how the changes each commit introduces are shown\.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-p
.RS 4
Generate patch (see section on generating patches)\.
.RE
.PP
\-u
.RS 4
Synonym for "\-p"\.
.RE
.PP
\-U<n>
.RS 4
Shorthand for "\-\-unified=<n>"\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-unified=<n>
.RS 4
Generate diffs with <n> lines of context instead of the usual three\. Implies "\-p"\.
.RE
.PP

.RE
.PP
\-\-patch\-with\-raw
.RS 4
Synonym for "\-p \-\-raw"\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-stat[=width[,name\-width]]
.RS 4
Generate a diffstat\. You can override the default output width for 80\-column terminal by "\-\-stat=width"\. The width of the filename part can be controlled by giving another width to it separated by a comma\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-numstat
.RS 4
Similar to \-\-stat, but shows number of added and deleted lines in decimal notation and pathname without abbreviation, to make it more machine friendly\. For binary files, outputs two \- instead of saying 0 0\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-shortstat
.RS 4
Output only the last line of the \-\-stat format containing total number of modified files, as well as number of added and deleted lines\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-dirstat[=limit]
.RS 4
Output only the sub\-directories that are impacted by a diff, and to what degree they are impacted\. You can override the default cut\-off in percent (3) by "\-\-dirstat=limit"\. If you want to enable "cumulative" directory statistics, you can use the "\-\-cumulative" flag, which adds up percentages recursively even when they have been already reported for a sub\-directory\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-summary
.RS 4
Output a condensed summary of extended header information such as creations, renames and mode changes\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-patch\-with\-stat
.RS 4
Synonym for "\-p \-\-stat"\.
.RE
.PP
\-z
.RS 4
NUL\-line termination on output\. This affects the \-\-raw output field terminator\. Also output from commands such as "git\-log" will be delimited with NUL between commits\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-name\-only
.RS 4
Show only names of changed files\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-name\-status
.RS 4
Show only names and status of changed files\. See the description of the \-\-diff\-filter option on what the status letters mean\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-color
.RS 4
Show colored diff\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-no\-color
.RS 4
Turn off colored diff, even when the configuration file gives the default to color output\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-color\-words
.RS 4
Show colored word diff, i\.e\. color words which have changed\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-no\-renames
.RS 4
Turn off rename detection, even when the configuration file gives the default to do so\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-check
.RS 4
Warn if changes introduce trailing whitespace or an indent that uses a space before a tab\. Exits with non\-zero status if problems are found\. Not compatible with \-\-exit\-code\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-full\-index
.RS 4
Instead of the first handful of characters, show the full pre\- and post\-image blob object names on the "index" line when generating patch format output\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-binary
.RS 4
In addition to \-\-full\-index, output "binary diff" that can be applied with "git apply"\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-abbrev[=<n>]
.RS 4
Instead of showing the full 40\-byte hexadecimal object name in diff\-raw format output and diff\-tree header lines, show only handful hexdigits prefix\. This is independent of \-\-full\-index option above, which controls the diff\-patch output format\. Non default number of digits can be specified with \-\-abbrev=<n>\.
.RE
.PP
\-B
.RS 4
Break complete rewrite changes into pairs of delete and create\.
.RE
.PP
\-M
.RS 4
Detect renames\.
.RE
.PP
\-C
.RS 4
Detect copies as well as renames\. See also \-\-find\-copies\-harder\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-diff\-filter=[ACDMRTUXB*]
.RS 4
Select only files that are Added (A), Copied (C), Deleted (D), Modified (M), Renamed (R), have their type (mode) changed (T), are Unmerged (U), are Unknown (X), or have had their pairing Broken (B)\. Any combination of the filter characters may be used\. When * (All\-or\-none) is added to the combination, all paths are selected if there is any file that matches other criteria in the comparison; if there is no file that matches other criteria, nothing is selected\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-find\-copies\-harder
.RS 4
For performance reasons, by default, \-C option finds copies only if the original file of the copy was modified in the same changeset\. This flag makes the command inspect unmodified files as candidates for the source of copy\. This is a very expensive operation for large projects, so use it with caution\. Giving more than one \-C option has the same effect\.
.RE
.PP
\-l<num>
.RS 4
\-M and \-C options require O(n^2) processing time where n is the number of potential rename/copy targets\. This option prevents rename/copy detection from running if the number of rename/copy targets exceeds the specified number\.
.RE
.PP
\-S<string>
.RS 4
Look for differences that contain the change in <string>\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-pickaxe\-all
.RS 4
When \-S finds a change, show all the changes in that changeset, not just the files that contain the change in <string>\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-pickaxe\-regex
.RS 4
Make the <string> not a plain string but an extended POSIX regex to match\.
.RE
.PP
\-O<orderfile>
.RS 4
Output the patch in the order specified in the <orderfile>, which has one shell glob pattern per line\.
.RE
.PP
\-R
.RS 4
Swap two inputs; that is, show differences from index or on\-disk file to tree contents\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-relative[=<path>]
.RS 4
When run from a subdirectory of the project, it can be told to exclude changes outside the directory and show pathnames relative to it with this option\. When you are not in a subdirectory (e\.g\. in a bare repository), you can name which subdirectory to make the output relative to by giving a <path> as an argument\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-text
.RS 4
Treat all files as text\.
.RE
.PP
\-a
.RS 4
Shorthand for "\-\-text"\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-ignore\-space\-at\-eol
.RS 4
Ignore changes in whitespace at EOL\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-ignore\-space\-change
.RS 4
Ignore changes in amount of whitespace\. This ignores whitespace at line end, and considers all other sequences of one or more whitespace characters to be equivalent\.
.RE
.PP
\-b
.RS 4
Shorthand for "\-\-ignore\-space\-change"\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-ignore\-all\-space
.RS 4
Ignore whitespace when comparing lines\. This ignores differences even if one line has whitespace where the other line has none\.
.RE
.PP
\-w
.RS 4
Shorthand for "\-\-ignore\-all\-space"\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-exit\-code
.RS 4
Make the program exit with codes similar to diff(1)\. That is, it exits with 1 if there were differences and 0 means no differences\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-quiet
.RS 4
Disable all output of the program\. Implies \-\-exit\-code\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-ext\-diff
.RS 4
Allow an external diff helper to be executed\. If you set an external diff driver with \fBgitattributes\fR(5), you need to use this option with \fBgit-log\fR(1) and friends\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-no\-ext\-diff
.RS 4
Disallow external diff drivers\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-ignore\-submodules
.RS 4
Ignore changes to submodules in the diff generation\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-src\-prefix=<prefix>
.RS 4
Show the given source prefix instead of "a/"\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-dst\-prefix=<prefix>
.RS 4
Show the given destination prefix instead of "b/"\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-no\-prefix
.RS 4
Do not show any source or destination prefix\.
.RE
For more detailed explanation on these common options, see also \fBgitdiffcore\fR(7)\.
.PP
\-<n>
.RS 4
Limits the number of commits to show\.
.RE
.PP
<since>\.\.<until>
.RS 4
Show only commits between the named two commits\. When either <since> or <until> is omitted, it defaults to HEAD, i\.e\. the tip of the current branch\. For a more complete list of ways to spell <since> and <until>, see "SPECIFYING REVISIONS" section in \fBgit-rev-parse\fR(1)\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-decorate
.RS 4
Print out the ref names of any commits that are shown\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-full\-diff
.RS 4
Without this flag, "git log \-p <path>\&..." shows commits that touch the specified paths, and diffs about the same specified paths\. With this, the full diff is shown for commits that touch the specified paths; this means that "<path>\&..." limits only commits, and doesn\'t limit diff for those commits\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-follow
.RS 4
Continue listing the history of a file beyond renames\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-log\-size
.RS 4
Before the log message print out its size in bytes\. Intended mainly for porcelain tools consumption\. If git is unable to produce a valid value size is set to zero\. Note that only message is considered, if also a diff is shown its size is not included\.
.RE
.PP
<path>\&...
.RS 4
Show only commits that affect any of the specified paths\.
.RE
.SS "Commit Formatting"
.PP
\-\-pretty[=\fI<format>\fR]
.RS 4
Pretty\-print the contents of the commit logs in a given format, where \fI<format>\fR can be one of \fIoneline\fR, \fIshort\fR, \fImedium\fR, \fIfull\fR, \fIfuller\fR, \fIemail\fR, \fIraw\fR and \fIformat:<string>\fR\. When omitted, the format defaults to \fImedium\fR\.

Note: you can specify the default pretty format in the repository configuration (see \fBgit-config\fR(1))\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-abbrev\-commit
.RS 4
Instead of showing the full 40\-byte hexadecimal commit object name, show only handful hexdigits prefix\. Non default number of digits can be specified with "\-\-abbrev=<n>" (which also modifies diff output, if it is displayed)\.

This should make "\-\-pretty=oneline" a whole lot more readable for people using 80\-column terminals\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-encoding[=<encoding>]
.RS 4
The commit objects record the encoding used for the log message in their encoding header; this option can be used to tell the command to re\-code the commit log message in the encoding preferred by the user\. For non plumbing commands this defaults to UTF\-8\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-relative\-date
.RS 4
Synonym for \-\-date=relative\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-date={relative,local,default,iso,rfc,short}
.RS 4
Only takes effect for dates shown in human\-readable format, such as when using "\-\-pretty"\. log\.date config variable sets a default value for log command\'s \-\-date option\.

\-\-date=relative shows dates relative to the current time, e\.g\. "2 hours ago"\.

\-\-date=local shows timestamps in user\'s local timezone\.

\-\-date=iso (or \-\-date=iso8601) shows timestamps in ISO 8601 format\.

\-\-date=rfc (or \-\-date=rfc2822) shows timestamps in RFC 2822 format, often found in E\-mail messages\.

\-\-date=short shows only date but not time, in YYYY\-MM\-DD format\.

\-\-date=default shows timestamps in the original timezone (either committer\'s or author\'s)\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-parents
.RS 4
Print the parents of the commit\. Also enables parent rewriting, see \fIHistory Simplification\fR below\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-children
.RS 4
Print the children of the commit\. Also enables parent rewriting, see \fIHistory Simplification\fR below\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-left\-right
.RS 4
Mark which side of a symmetric diff a commit is reachable from\. Commits from the left side are prefixed with < and those from the right with >\. If combined with \-\-boundary, those commits are prefixed with \-\.

For example, if you have this topology:

.sp
.RS 4
.nf

\.ft C
             y\-\-\-b\-\-\-b  branch B
            / \e /
           /   \.
          /   / \e
         o\-\-\-x\-\-\-a\-\-\-a  branch A
\.ft

.fi
.RE
you would get an output like this:

.sp
.RS 4
.nf

\.ft C
        $ git rev\-list \-\-left\-right \-\-boundary \-\-pretty=oneline A\.\.\.B

        >bbbbbbb\.\.\. 3rd on b
        >bbbbbbb\.\.\. 2nd on b
        <aaaaaaa\.\.\. 3rd on a
        <aaaaaaa\.\.\. 2nd on a
        \-yyyyyyy\.\.\. 1st on b
        \-xxxxxxx\.\.\. 1st on a
\.ft

.fi
.RE
.RE
.PP
\-\-graph
.RS 4
Draw a text\-based graphical representation of the commit history on the left hand side of the output\. This may cause extra lines to be printed in between commits, in order for the graph history to be drawn properly\.

This implies the \fI\-\-topo\-order\fR option by default, but the \fI\-\-date\-order\fR option may also be specified\.
.RE
.SS "Diff Formatting"
Below are listed options that control the formatting of diff output\. Some of them are specific to \fBgit-rev-list\fR(1), however other diff options may be given\. See \fBgit-diff-files\fR(1) for more options\.
.PP
\-c
.RS 4
This flag changes the way a merge commit is displayed\. It shows the differences from each of the parents to the merge result simultaneously instead of showing pairwise diff between a parent and the result one at a time\. Furthermore, it lists only files which were modified from all parents\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-cc
.RS 4
This flag implies the \fI\-c\fR options and further compresses the patch output by omitting uninteresting hunks whose contents in the parents have only two variants and the merge result picks one of them without modification\.
.RE
.PP
\-r
.RS 4
Show recursive diffs\.
.RE
.PP
\-t
.RS 4
Show the tree objects in the diff output\. This implies \fI\-r\fR\.
.RE
.SS "Commit Limiting"
Besides specifying a range of commits that should be listed using the special notations explained in the description, additional commit limiting may be applied\.
.PP
\-n \fInumber\fR, \-\-max\-count=\fInumber\fR
.RS 4
Limit the number of commits output\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-skip=\fInumber\fR
.RS 4
Skip \fInumber\fR commits before starting to show the commit output\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-since=\fIdate\fR, \-\-after=\fIdate\fR
.RS 4
Show commits more recent than a specific date\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-until=\fIdate\fR, \-\-before=\fIdate\fR
.RS 4
Show commits older than a specific date\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-author=\fIpattern\fR, \-\-committer=\fIpattern\fR
.RS 4
Limit the commits output to ones with author/committer header lines that match the specified pattern (regular expression)\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-grep=\fIpattern\fR
.RS 4
Limit the commits output to ones with log message that matches the specified pattern (regular expression)\.
.RE
.PP
\-i, \-\-regexp\-ignore\-case
.RS 4
Match the regexp limiting patterns without regard to letters case\.
.RE
.PP
\-E, \-\-extended\-regexp
.RS 4
Consider the limiting patterns to be extended regular expressions instead of the default basic regular expressions\.
.RE
.PP
\-F, \-\-fixed\-strings
.RS 4
Consider the limiting patterns to be fixed strings (don\'t interpret pattern as a regular expression)\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-remove\-empty
.RS 4
Stop when a given path disappears from the tree\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-no\-merges
.RS 4
Do not print commits with more than one parent\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-first\-parent
.RS 4
Follow only the first parent commit upon seeing a merge commit\. This option can give a better overview when viewing the evolution of a particular topic branch, because merges into a topic branch tend to be only about adjusting to updated upstream from time to time, and this option allows you to ignore the individual commits brought in to your history by such a merge\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-not
.RS 4
Reverses the meaning of the \fI^\fR prefix (or lack thereof) for all following revision specifiers, up to the next \fI\-\-not\fR\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-all
.RS 4
Pretend as if all the refs in $GIT_DIR/refs/ are listed on the command line as \fI<commit>\fR\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-cherry\-pick
.RS 4
Omit any commit that introduces the same change as another commit on the "other side" when the set of commits are limited with symmetric difference\. For example, if you have two branches, A and B, a usual way to list all commits on only one side of them is with \-\-left\-right, like the example above in the description of that option\. It however shows the commits that were cherry\-picked from the other branch (for example, "3rd on b" may be cherry\-picked from branch A)\. With this option, such pairs of commits are excluded from the output\.
.RE
.PP
\-g, \-\-walk\-reflogs
.RS 4
Instead of walking the commit ancestry chain, walk reflog entries from the most recent one to older ones\. When this option is used you cannot specify commits to exclude (that is, \fI^commit\fR, \fIcommit1\.\.commit2\fR, nor \fIcommit1\&...commit2\fR notations cannot be used)\. With \fI\-\-pretty\fR format other than oneline (for obvious reasons), this causes the output to have two extra lines of information taken from the reflog\. By default, \fIcommit@{Nth}\fR notation is used in the output\. When the starting commit is specified as \fIcommit@{now}\fR, output also uses \fIcommit@{timestamp}\fR notation instead\. Under \fI\-\-pretty=oneline\fR, the commit message is prefixed with this information on the same line\. This option cannot be combined with \fI\-\-reverse\fR\. See also \fBgit-reflog\fR(1)\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-merge
.RS 4
After a failed merge, show refs that touch files having a conflict and don\'t exist on all heads to merge\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-boundary
.RS 4
Output uninteresting commits at the boundary, which are usually not shown\.
.RE
.SS "History Simplification"
When optional paths are given, \fIgit\-rev\-list\fR simplifies commits with various strategies, according to the options you have selected\.

Suppose you specified foo as the <paths>\. We shall call commits that modify foo !TREESAME, and the rest TREESAME\. (In a diff filtered for foo, they look different and equal, respectively\.)

In the following, we will always refer to the same example history to illustrate the differences between simplification settings\. We assume that you are filtering for a file foo in this commit graph:

.sp
.RS 4
.nf

\.ft C
          \.\-A\-\-\-M\-\-\-N\-\-\-O\-\-\-P
         /     /   /   /   /
        I     B   C   D   E
         \e   /   /   /   /
          `\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\'
\.ft

.fi
.RE
The horizontal line of history A\-\-P is taken to be the first parent of each merge\. The commits are:

.sp
.RS 4
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'I is the initial commit, in which foo exists with contents "asdf", and a file quux exists with contents "quux"\. Initial commits are compared to an empty tree, so I is !TREESAME\.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'In A, foo contains just "foo"\.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'B contains the same change as A\. Its merge M is trivial and hence TREESAME to all parents\.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'C does not change foo, but its merge N changes it to "foobar", so it is not TREESAME to any parent\.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'D sets foo to "baz"\. Its merge O combines the strings from N and D to "foobarbaz"; i\.e\., it is not TREESAME to any parent\.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'E changes quux to "xyzzy", and its merge P combines the strings to "quux xyzzy"\. Despite appearing interesting, P is TREESAME to all parents\.
.RE
\fIrev\-list\fR walks backwards through history, including or excluding commits based on whether \fI\-\-full\-history\fR and/or parent rewriting (via \fI\-\-parents\fR or \fI\-\-children\fR) are used\. The following settings are available\.
.PP
Default mode
.RS 4
Commits are included if they are not TREESAME to any parent (though this can be changed, see \fI\-\-sparse\fR below)\. If the commit was a merge, and it was TREESAME to one parent, follow only that parent\. (Even if there are several TREESAME parents, follow only one of them\.) Otherwise, follow all parents\.

This results in:

.sp
.RS 4
.nf

\.ft C
          \.\-A\-\-\-N\-\-\-O
         /         /
        I\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-D
\.ft

.fi
.RE
Note how the rule to only follow the TREESAME parent, if one is available, removed B from consideration entirely\. C was considered via N, but is TREESAME\. Root commits are compared to an empty tree, so I is !TREESAME\.

Parent/child relations are only visible with \-\-parents, but that does not affect the commits selected in default mode, so we have shown the parent lines\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-full\-history without parent rewriting
.RS 4
This mode differs from the default in one point: always follow all parents of a merge, even if it is TREESAME to one of them\. Even if more than one side of the merge has commits that are included, this does not imply that the merge itself is! In the example, we get

.sp
.RS 4
.nf

\.ft C
        I  A  B  N  D  O
\.ft

.fi
.RE
P and M were excluded because they are TREESAME to a parent\. E, C and B were all walked, but only B was !TREESAME, so the others do not appear\.

Note that without parent rewriting, it is not really possible to talk about the parent/child relationships between the commits, so we show them disconnected\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-full\-history with parent rewriting
.RS 4
Ordinary commits are only included if they are !TREESAME (though this can be changed, see \fI\-\-sparse\fR below)\.

Merges are always included\. However, their parent list is rewritten: Along each parent, prune away commits that are not included themselves\. This results in

.sp
.RS 4
.nf

\.ft C
          \.\-A\-\-\-M\-\-\-N\-\-\-O\-\-\-P
         /     /   /   /   /
        I     B   /   D   /
         \e   /   /   /   /
          `\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\'
\.ft

.fi
.RE
Compare to \fI\-\-full\-history\fR without rewriting above\. Note that E was pruned away because it is TREESAME, but the parent list of P was rewritten to contain E\'s parent I\. The same happened for C and N\. Note also that P was included despite being TREESAME\.
.RE
In addition to the above settings, you can change whether TREESAME affects inclusion:
.PP
\-\-dense
.RS 4
Commits that are walked are included if they are not TREESAME to any parent\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-sparse
.RS 4
All commits that are walked are included\.

Note that without \fI\-\-full\-history\fR, this still simplifies merges: if one of the parents is TREESAME, we follow only that one, so the other sides of the merge are never walked\.
.RE
.SS "Commit Ordering"
By default, the commits are shown in reverse chronological order\.
.PP
\-\-topo\-order
.RS 4
This option makes them appear in topological order (i\.e\. descendant commits are shown before their parents)\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-date\-order
.RS 4
This option is similar to \fI\-\-topo\-order\fR in the sense that no parent comes before all of its children, but otherwise things are still ordered in the commit timestamp order\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-reverse
.RS 4
Output the commits in reverse order\. Cannot be combined with \fI\-\-walk\-reflogs\fR\.
.RE
.SS "Object Traversal"
These options are mostly targeted for packing of git repositories\.
.PP
\-\-objects
.RS 4
Print the object IDs of any object referenced by the listed commits\. \fI\-\-objects foo ^bar\fR thus means "send me all object IDs which I need to download if I have the commit object \fIbar\fR, but not \fIfoo\fR"\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-objects\-edge
.RS 4
Similar to \fI\-\-objects\fR, but also print the IDs of excluded commits prefixed with a "\-" character\. This is used by \fBgit-pack-objects\fR(1) to build "thin" pack, which records objects in deltified form based on objects contained in these excluded commits to reduce network traffic\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-unpacked
.RS 4
Only useful with \fI\-\-objects\fR; print the object IDs that are not in packs\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-no\-walk
.RS 4
Only show the given revs, but do not traverse their ancestors\.
.RE
.PP

If the commit is a merge, and if the pretty\-format is not \fIoneline\fR, \fIemail\fR or \fIraw\fR, an additional line is inserted before the \fIAuthor:\fR line\. This line begins with "Merge: " and the sha1s of ancestral commits are printed, separated by spaces\. Note that the listed commits may not necessarily be the list of the \fBdirect\fR parent commits if you have limited your view of history: for example, if you are only interested in changes related to a certain directory or file\.

The \fItformat:\fR format works exactly like \fIformat:\fR, except that it provides "terminator" semantics instead of "separator" semantics\. In other words, each commit has the message terminator character (usually a newline) appended, rather than a separator placed between entries\. This means that the final entry of a single\-line format will be properly terminated with a new line, just as the "oneline" format does\. For example:

The similarity index is the percentage of unchanged lines, and the dissimilarity index is the percentage of changed lines\. It is a rounded down integer, followed by a percent sign\. The similarity index value of 100% is thus reserved for two equal files, while 100% dissimilarity means that no line from the old file made it into the new one\.

\h'-04' 4.\h'+02'Chunk header format is modified to prevent people from accidentally feeding it to patch \-p1\. Combined diff format was created for review of merge commit changes, and was not meant for apply\. The change is similar to the change in the extended \fIindex\fR header:

There are (number of parents + 1) @ characters in the chunk header for combined diff format\.

Unlike the traditional \fIunified\fR diff format, which shows two files A and B with a single column that has \- (minus \(em appears in A but removed in B), + (plus \(em missing in A but added to B), or " " (space \(em unchanged) prefix, this format compares two or more files file1, file2,\&... with one file X, and shows how X differs from each of fileN\. One column for each of fileN is prepended to the output line to note how X\'s line is different from it\.

A \- character in the column N means that the line appears in fileN but it does not appear in the result\. A + character in the column N means that the line appears in the last file, and fileN does not have that line (in other words, the line was added, from the point of view of that parent)\.

In the above example output, the function signature was changed from both files (hence two \- removals from both file1 and file2, plus + to mean one line that was added does not appear in either file1 nor file2)\. Also two other lines are the same from file1 but do not appear in file2 (hence prefixed with )\.

When shown by git diff\-tree \-c, it compares the parents of a merge commit with the merge result (i\.e\. file1\.\.fileN are the parents)\. When shown by git diff\-files \-c, it compares the two unresolved merge parents with the working tree file (i\.e\. file1 is stage 2 aka "our version", file2 is stage 3 aka "their version")\.

Although we encourage that the commit log messages are encoded in UTF\-8, both the core and git Porcelain are designed not to force UTF\-8 on projects\.
