.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Applies a quilt patchset onto the current git branch, preserving the patch boundaries, patch order, and patch descriptions present in the quilt patchset\.

For each patch the code attempts to extract the author from the patch description\. If that fails it falls back to the author specified with \-\-author\. If the \-\-author flag was not given the patch description is displayed and the user is asked to interactively enter the author of the patch\.

If a subject is not found in the patch description the patch name is preserved as the 1 line subject in the git description\.
