.SH "DESCRIPTION"


Applies a quilt patchset onto the current git branch, preserving the patch boundaries, patch order, and patch descriptions present in the quilt patchset\&.


For each patch the code attempts to extract the author from the patch description\&. If that fails it falls back to the author specified with \-\-author\&. If the \-\-author flag was not given the patch description is displayed and the user is asked to interactively enter the author of the patch\&.


If a subject is not found in the patch description the patch name is preserved as the 1 line subject in the git description\&.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
\-\-dry\-run
Walk through the patches in the series and warn if we cannot find all of the necessary information to commit a patch\&. At the time of this writing only missing author information is warned about\&.

.TP
\-\-author Author Name <Author Email>
The author name and email address to use when no author information can be found in the patch description\&.

.TP
\-\-patches <dir>
The directory to find the quilt patches and the quilt series file\&.

.nf
The default for the patch directory is patches
