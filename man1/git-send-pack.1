.SH NAME
git-send-pack \- Push missing objects packed.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"


git\-send\-pack [\-\-all] [\-\-force] [\-\-exec=<git\-receive\-pack>] [<host>:]<directory> [<ref>...]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"


Invokes git\-receive\-pack on a possibly remote repository, and updates it from the current repository, sending named refs\&.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
\-\-exec=<git\-receive\-pack>
Path to the git\-receive\-pack program on the remote end\&. Sometimes useful when pushing to a remote repository over ssh, and you do not have the program in a directory on the default $PATH\&.

.TP
\-\-all
Instead of explicitly specifying which refs to update, update all refs that locally exist\&.

.TP
\-\-force
Usually, the command refuses to update a remote ref that is not an ancestor of the local ref used to overwrite it\&. This flag disables the check\&. What this means is that the remote repository can lose commits; use it with care\&.

.TP
<host>
A remote host to house the repository\&. When this part is specified, git\-receive\-pack is invoked via ssh\&.

.TP
<directory>
The repository to update\&.


<ref>...: The remote refs to update\&.

.SH "SPECIFYING THE REFS"


There are three ways to specify which refs to update on the remote end\&.


With \-\-all flag, all refs that exist locally are transfered to the remote side\&. You cannot specify any <ref> if you use this flag\&.


Without \-\-all and without any <ref>, the refs that exist both on the local side and on the remote side are updated\&.


When one or more <ref> are specified explicitly, it can be either a single pattern, or a pair of such pattern separated by a colon ":" (this means that a ref name cannot have a colon in it)\&. A single pattern <name> is just a shorthand for <name>:<name>\&.


Each pattern pair consists of the source side (before the colon) and the destination side (after the colon)\&. The ref to be pushed is determined by finding a match that matches the source side, and where it is pushed is determined by using the destination side\&.

.TP 3
\(bu
It is an error if <src> does not match exactly one of the local refs\&.
.TP
\(bu
It is an error if <dst> matches more than one remote refs\&.
.TP
\(bu
If <dst> does not match any remote ref, either

.RS
.TP 3
\(bu
it has to start with "refs/"; <dst> is used as the destination literally in this case\&.
.TP
\(bu
<src> == <dst> and the ref that matched the <src> must not exist in the set of remote refs; the ref matched <src> locally is used as the name of the destination\&.
.LP
.RE
.IP
.LP


Without \-\-force, the <src> ref is stored at the remote only if <dst> does not exist, or <dst> is a proper subset (i\&.e\&. an ancestor) of <src>\&. This check, known as "fast forward check", is performed in order to avoid accidentally overwriting the remote ref and lose other peoples' commits from there\&.


With \-\-force, the fast forward check is disabled for all refs\&.


Optionally, a <ref> parameter can be prefixed with a plus + sign to disable the fast\-forward check only on that ref\&.
